There is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law for certain pieces of personal information, for example: unique identifiers such as cookie IDs, device ID, and IP address (where that information is not held by us in connection with directly identifiable information).

11.LINK DI TERZI
La nostra App può includere link a siti web, plug-in e applicazioni di terze parti. Facendo clic su tali link o abilitando tali collegamenti, è possibile che terzi possano raccogliere o condividere i dati che vi riguardano. Non controlliamo questi siti web, plug-in e app di terze parti e non siamo responsabili delle loro pratiche sulla privacy. Quando lasciate il nostro sito web, vi invitiamo a leggere l'informativa sulla privacy di ogni terza parte che visitate.
12.CHE TIPO DI INFORMAZIONI RACCOGLIAMO SUI BAMBINI?
12.1Se un utente ha indicato di essere un bambino quando tenta di utilizzare la nostra App, lo indirizzeremo a un'esperienza diversa all'interno della nostra App che consente a un bambino di utilizzare i nostri servizi come qualsiasi altro utente, ma che non consente la raccolta di ulteriori informazioni personali (come definito in COPPA).
12.2Raccogliamo solo una parte delle informazioni personali di cui sopra quando un utente si identifica come un bambino, compresi nome utente e identificativi univoci. I bambini possono utilizzare la nostra App, visualizzare i contenuti e usufruire di molte funzioni senza la raccolta di informazioni personali (come definito in COPPA) e, qualora il consenso del genitore sia richiesto dalla legge, lo richiederemo.
13.ULTERIORI DIRITTI DI PRIVACY PER I RESIDENTI IN CALIFORNIA
13.1Il presente paragrafo fornisce informazioni aggiuntive richieste dalla legge californiana.
13.2Se siete un consumatore californiano i cui dati personali sono raccolti tramite l'App ("cliente"), il California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") vi conferisce alcuni diritti in relazione a tali dati personali. In particolare, avete il diritto di richiedere che le aziende vi forniscano le seguenti informazioni:
(a)Le categorie e le specifiche informazioni personali che abbiamo raccolto su di voi.
(b)Le categorie o fonti da cui raccogliamo i dati personali.
(c)Le finalità di raccolta e utilizzo dei dati personali.
(d)Le categorie di terzi con cui condividiamo i dati personali.

13.3Avete inoltre il diritto di richiedere la cancellazione dei dati personali in determinate circostanze, fatte salve alcune eccezioni. Inoltre, avete il diritto di non essere discriminati per aver esercitato uno qualsiasi di questi diritti.
13.4È possibile esercitare i diritti di cui sopra contattandoci utilizzando i recapiti di cui al paragrafo 2 della presente Informativa sulla privacy. Se inviate una richiesta, vi chiederemo di verificare la vostra identità dove, se possibile, possiamo abbinare i vostri dati identificativi con i dati personali che abbiamo su di voi, a seconda del tipo di richiesta effettuata e delle misure di verifica proporzionali al rischio dei dati personali coinvolti nella richiesta (o nelle richieste). Non esiste un metodo ragionevole con cui possiamo verificare la vostra identità nel grado di certezza richiesto dalla legge per alcune informazioni personali, ad esempio: identificativi univoci come ID cookie, ID del dispositivo e indirizzo IP (laddove tali informazioni non sono in nostro possesso in relazione a informazioni direttamente identificabili). Ci possono essere eccezioni a tali diritti in determinate circostanze e, qualora non possiate esercitare un diritto a causa di un'eccezione, Pokémon vi fornirà tali informazioni. Pokémon si adopererà ragionevolmente per soddisfare la richiesta dell'utente entro i tempi di risposta previsti dalle leggi applicabili.
13.5Pokémon non vende le vostre informazioni personali come definite dal CCPA e non lo ha fatto negli ultimi 12 mesi.
13.6Oltre alle finalità per cui le vostre informazioni personali sono condivise con altre terze parti (inclusi i consulenti professionali) di cui ai precedenti paragrafi 5.1(h) e 6, un’altra finalità prevista è la condivisione per scopi aziendali che richiedono l'accesso ai nostri sistemi contenenti informazioni personali (come la fornitura di spazio di archiviazione di dati nel cloud, il mantenimento della sicurezza dei nostri sistemi e la fornitura di assistenza clienti). Negli ultimi 12 mesi, abbiamo comunicato ai fornitori tutte le categorie di dati personali descritte nel paragrafo 3.
13.7L'articolo 1798.83 del Codice Civile della California consente ai clienti residenti in California di richiedere determinate informazioni relative alla divulgazione di informazioni personali a terzi per i propri scopi di marketing diretto. Non condividiamo i dati personali dei nostri clienti con terzi non affiliati per i loro scopi di marketing diretto senza il consenso dell'utente.
