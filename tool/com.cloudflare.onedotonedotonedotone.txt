As used in this Application Privacy Policy, “Cloudflare,” “Us” or “We” refers to Cloudflare, Inc. and its affiliates as listed at the end of this policy. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Application Terms of Service.This Application Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of the Application as part of Cloudflare Zero Trust, in which case the Cloudflare Privacy Policy applies.1. Scope of PolicyOur mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.This Policy only applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in connection with the use of the Cloudflare Application(s). This Policy does not apply to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the Application when the Application is used as part of a Cloudflare Zero Trust account, as described in more detail in Section 3.2. Information We CollectWe only collect and store the minimum amount of data we believe is required to operate and improve the Application. There are three categories of data that we collect: Account Data, Operational Data, and DNS Resolver Information as described more fully below. Your Account Data and Operational Data are pseudonymized. Your DNS Resolver Information is anonymized at our edge data centers.We do not collect your name, phone number, or credit card information (or records of any payments collected by the applicable App Store). The only information we receive from the applicable App Store is a limited amount of information that we need to confirm your subscription for a Service. We do not receive from the App Store any of your personal data or other information about your App Store account. We only receive your email address (and name, if you voluntarily provide it) if you have decided to give us feedback and/or report bugs.We promise to keep your personal information personal and private. We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. We will not share or otherwise disclose your personal information except as necessary to provide our services or as otherwise described in this Application Privacy Policy without first providing you with notice and the opportunity to consent.2.1 Account DataWhen you install the Application on your device, create or update your account, sign up for a Paid Application Service, or participate in one of our referral programs, we collect and store the “Account Data” described below, depending on your use of the Application.Account DataInformation TypePurposeAccountWe use account information, such as your account ID, to administer your account and authorize Internet requests from your device to the Cloudflare network.SubscriptionIf you subscribe to Paid Application Services, we use subscription information, such as your order ID, to administer those subscriptions.ReferralIf you participate in our referral programs, we use referral information, such as your registration ID, to credit referrals to you.2.2 Operational DataCloudflare also collects and stores “Operational Data” when you connect to our network. This data is required to operate and improve our Application.Operational DataInformation TypePurposeRequest data (Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP)When you connect to our network, we see your IP address and use it to assign you a Cloudflare IP address corresponding to the country in which you are connecting from. We do not retain a link between the IP address you use to access the Internet via our Application and the websites you visit.Performance dataWe track the services you have enabled and the amount of data you have transferred via the Application. We also use performance data to understand how the Application impacts your Internet connection and to improve our Application. Performance Data does not include personal information.Device dataWe use information regarding your device, such as device model and operating system, for troubleshooting and to improve our Application. This data does not include unique device identifiers.Crash LogsWe use crash log information regarding your device’s use of the Application for troubleshooting and to improve our Application. Crash logs do not contain your IP addresses or other personal information.Connection DataWe retain anonymized network information to look for connection problems between your device and Cloudflare’s network. You may disable the reporting of anonymized network information in the Application.Feedback/Bug ReportsWe require your email address when you provide feedback and bug reports. When you provide feedback, you can choose whether to share your console logs. Console logs can include your device name and IP address. We use this information for troubleshooting and to improve our Application. Your email address will be deleted 6 months from the date of collection.2.3 DNS Resolver InformationWe collect limited DNS query data that is sent to the 1.1.1.1 Public DNS resolver when you have the Application enabled on your device. The DNS query data that we retain does not contain your IP addresses or personal information, and the bulk of the data is only stored for 24 hours. You can learn more about our 1.1.1.1 Public DNS Resolver commitment to privacy here.3. Cloudflare Zero Trust The Application may be used as part of the Cloudflare Zero Trust offerings to which you or your organization may subscribe. You understand that when your device is in Cloudflare Zero Trust mode, information we collect about your use of the Application and your Internet activity will be associated with your Cloudflare Zero Trust identity (e.g., work email address), and Cloudflare will process your personal data on behalf of the Cloudflare Zero Trust organization that you have associated with your account. All information provided by you or resulting from your use of the Application as part of Cloudflare Zero Trust services to which you or your organization subscribe is collected, used, maintained, shared, and destroyed in accordance with the Cloudflare Privacy Policy, available here, and this Application Privacy Policy will no longer apply.You further understand that when Cloudflare Zero Trust is enabled in the Application, Cloudflare may be able to associate your Cloudflare Zero Trust account information with your other use of the Application for up to 24 hours from when you enable Cloudflare Zero Trust.4. How We Use Information We CollectCloudflare only processes personal information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized. We use the information we collect, as described in Section 2 to operate and improve the Application, such as to assist us in our debugging efforts if an issue arises. We may also use the information we collect to comply with legal obligations as well as to investigate and prevent violations of the Application Terms of Service. We will not combine the information collected from DNS queries with any other Cloudflare or third party data in any way that can be used to identify individual end users. Learn more.5. RetentionWe store your personal data only as long as is necessary to provide our Application and the associated services, pursue legitimate interests, and comply with applicable laws. Your Account Data and Operational Data will be stored for no longer than two years after your last use of the Application. Information associated with feedback and bug reports may be retained longer as needed.6. Information SharingWe work with other companies who help us run our business (“Service Providers”). These companies provide services to help us operate and improve the Application, including assisting with debugging and crash analytics. These Service Providers may only process personal information pursuant to our instructions and in compliance both with this Application Privacy Policy, Cloudflare’s Privacy Policy and other applicable confidentiality and security measures and regulations.Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to sell any personal information we share with them, or to use any personal information we share with them for their own marketing purposes or for any other purpose than to perform the services they provide to us.In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above, we may also share your information with others in the following circumstances:Within the Cloudflare Group (defined for the purposes of this Application Privacy Policy as the Cloudflare entities listed at the end of this policy);When we are required to disclose personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process; or in the case of an emergency to protect any person from the danger of death or serious physical injury; or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
