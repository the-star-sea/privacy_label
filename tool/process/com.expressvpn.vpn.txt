HomePrivacy PolicyExpressVPN Privacy PolicyExpressVPN is committed to protecting your privacyWe want you to understand what information (including Personal Data) we collect in connection with your use of our Services and/or access to our Site; for what purpose such information is collected; how we collect, use, and store such information; to whom it may be disclosed; and how you can exercise your rights and access your information, verify its accuracy, correct and/or have it erased. Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required to operate world-class Services at scale. We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration. In service of this mission, ExpressVPNs headquarters and registered place of business is in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Express Technologies Ltd. operates under BVI jurisdiction, in accordance with BVI laws. Personal Data is collected for the purpose of providing you with our Services and may include the name, email address, and payment information that you submit to us when you create or update your Account.(ii) Aggregate Apps and VPN connection summary statistics (Usage Statistics Data)A minimal amount of Usage Statistics Data is collected in order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service. App Diagnostic Data is not shared by default. You must opt in, such as through the settings menu of your Apps, to send App Diagnostic Data to us.(v) IP addresses authorized to use MediaStreamer Services (MediaStreamer Data) (applicable only to MediaStreamer users)Separately from VPN services, we also provide our optional MediaStreamer service for devices that do not support VPNs (e.g., Apple TV). We require Personal Data, such as an email address and payment information, so that we can provide you with our Services, email you, collect payments, respond to support queries, and share relevant information about your Account and/or the Services. We have implemented best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security measures with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your Personal Data. Service Providers only have access to the data necessary for the services they are performing on behalf of ExpressVPN, which in any case will never include VPN activity or connection data as we do not collect such data. No ExpressVPN staff or Service Providers can view or retrieve the information you store in ExpressVPN Keys (not even if you authorize us to do so).Your Keys Data is your property. We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN server IP addresses they used. This minimal information assists us in providing technical support, such as identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to best use our Services, and enabling ExpressVPN engineers to identify and fix network issues.
