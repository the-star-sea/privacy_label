If you contact us directly, we may receive data such as your name, email address, phone number, content of the message and/or attachments, and any other personal data you may choose to provide to us in your communication to us. You cannot be identified from this abstracted data. This unique identifier, without reference to other data, identifies you through your device identification code. For example, we may investigate and address concerns, monitor and improve our customer support, respond to your questions and feedback, and inform you of suggestive steps to resolve certain regular customer issues.
