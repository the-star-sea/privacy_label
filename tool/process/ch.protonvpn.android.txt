Network traffic that may go through third-partiesProton's alternative routing technology allows Proton Services to bypass many censorship blocks, but in doing so your network traffic may go through third-party networks, which we do not control. By default, alternative routing is not used for Proton apps unless they detect that censorship measures are active on your network. Processors never store data outside of the scope of their specific purpose. Data disclosureWe will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we are legally obligated to do so by a binding request coming from the competent Swiss authorities. Under Swiss law, subjects of judicial procedures have to be notified of such procedures, although such notification has to come from the authorities and not from the Company.
