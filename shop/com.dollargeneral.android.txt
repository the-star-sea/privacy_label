If you are an authorized agent who would like to submit a Request to Out Out of Sale and/or Sharing, Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information, Know, Delete, or Correct on behalf of a California resident, please either contact us by phone at 1-800-678-9258 or select the option on the form here to indicate that you are submitting this request for “someone else.” As part of our verification process, we will contact you by email to request that you provide proof of your status as an authorized agent. In addition, we may require that the resident on whose behalf you are making the request verify their identity directly with us or confirm directly with us that they provided you permission to submit the request.
Notice of Financial Incentives
We offer our customers the opportunity to become Dollar General account holders and thereby receive benefits, including access to discounts, coupons, and/or special offers.
Our collection of Dollar General account holders’ Personal Information (including name, email address, phone number, purchase details and other personal information as described above under “Collection, Disclosure, Sale, and Sharing of Personal Information”) allows us to operate Dollar General accounts and provide benefits to Dollar General account holders. We use the Personal Information of Dollar General account holders to provide additional discounts, coupons, or other special offers. The amount of Personal Information that we collect from Dollar General account holders may vary and is dependent on the level of interactions and engagement that the Dollar General account holder has with us.
We seek to ensure that both Dollar General account holders and non-Dollar General account holders have a positive experience when seeking and purchasing products. For this reason, we may collect information from both Dollar General account holders and non-Dollar General account holders related to their personal preferences in order to provide personalized services, as described above under “Purposes for the Collection, Use, Sale and Sharing of Personal Information.”  We “sell” and “share,” as those terms are defined under the CCPA, Personal Information of both Dollar General account holders and non-Dollar General account holders to third parties for the purposes of personalizing online advertising content, as described in this Privacy Policy.
We estimate the value of a Dollar General account holder’s Personal Information to us, solely for purposes of the CCPA and pursuant to the valuation options mandated by the CCPA regulations, to be reasonably related to the value of the benefits that Dollar General account holders obtain through becoming Dollar General account holders.  We have based this good faith estimate on the value that arises from our commercial relationships, such as with vendors and customers, the costs and expenses we incur in offering benefits to Dollar General account holders, the types of discounts, coupons and special offers provided, and the collection, use and retention of the Personal Information of consumers who have voluntarily signed up and chosen to remain Dollar General account holders.  The value of benefits to Dollar General account holders varies, as individual account holders take advantage of their benefits to varying degrees.
You may become a Dollar General account holder here. Dollar General account holders who are California residents may exercise their CCPA rights, including the rights to know and correct, and to opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information, without any effect on their status as Dollar General account holders or eligibility to receive benefits, and Dollar General account holders who exercise their privacy rights under the CCPA receive the same benefits as Dollar General account holders who do not. If Dollar General account holders exercise their CCPA deletion right by choosing to delete their Dollar General account, then we will no longer be able to provide them with the benefits associated with that account once we have honored their deletion request. A Dollar General account holder may also choose not to receive marketing communications or offers at any time without any effect on their status as a Dollar General account holder or eligibility to receive benefits.  You may opt out of being a Dollar General account holder and delete your Dollar General account at any time by contacting us at 1-800-678-9258 or by submitting a request to delete here.
California Do Not Track Policy.
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. At this time, we do not currently participate in any “Do Not Track” (DNT) systems that would allow us to respond to such browser “do not track” signals.
