We may use these automated technologies to collect information about your equipment, browsing actions, and usage patterns. The information we may obtain through these automated technologies is described in the “Information we obtain by automated means” section of this Privacy Policy, above. We may use these automated technologies to:
authenticate your account and store your password if you are a registered Chewy account holder and otherwise detect and prevent fraud;
monitor the performance of our Services;

personalize your experience on our Sites, Apps and Social Media Services;

Interest-based advertising. We and third-party ad technology providers may use cookies to learn about the ads you see and interact with, and other actions you take on our Services. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads on both Chewy-owned and operated Services and third-party websites, apps and online services. Interest-based ads, also referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information collected about your online activities, such as when you browse or purchase a product on our Sites or Apps, or visit third-party websites, apps or online services.

Third-party ad technology companies may help us display content tailored to your interests and serve interest-based advertising on our behalf. Additionally, some third-party ad technology companies may provide us with information about you (such as demographic information) from offline and online sources, which we may use to provide you with more relevant and useful advertising.
Advertisers or third-party ad technology companies working on their behalf sometimes use automated technologies to serve the ads that appear on our Sites and Apps. They automatically receive your IP address and other device identifiers when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.

Cookies: The “Help” feature on most Internet browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you set your browser to limit or remove cookies or otherwise block our use of cookies, some Site features may be unavailable or unable to function properly. Your device may not give you the ability to control cookies. If you wish to block cookies on our App, you may need to delete the App from your mobile device.
Email marketing opt-out: If you wish to opt out of any of our marketing email communications you may contact our customer service representatives at the phone number or email address below, under the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy. You also may follow the “unsubscribe” instructions included in our promotional emails. Please note that removal of user information from our database or “opting out” will not stop marketing or advertising content that is generated for distribution or is otherwise queued for transmission to you prior to the time when we can implement your request.  If you unsubscribe from marketing communications, you may continue to receive transactional communications, such as email or text notifications about your order status, recall information and other administrative information. Your information will remain in our database, but will be marked as inactive so you do not receive marketing materials from us.
Interest-based advertising opt-out: You may opt out of receiving interest-based ads from us by visiting the DAA consumer opt-out page at https://www.aboutads.info/choices. You also can opt out of receiving interest-based ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) by visiting the NAI consumer opt-out page at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/. Opting out of receiving interest-based ads does not mean that you will no longer receive ads from us, but rather that the ads you receive may not be as relevant to your interests.
Apps opt-out: You may use the DAA’s AppChoices program to opt out of receiving certain in-app interest-based ads (see: https://youradchoices.com/appchoices). Your mobile device may also provide a device-level advertising preference feature that prevents your device from receiving in-app interest-based ads.
Do-Not-Track: Some Internet browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Our Sites and Apps do not support “do not track” preferences that may be available in your browser and are not capable of satisfying the preference you set.
DATA RETENTION
We retain your information for the time period reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or any other notice provided at the time of collection, taking into account applicable statutes of limitation and records retention requirements under applicable law.
DATA SECURITY
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the information we collect.
INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN
The Sites and Apps are designed for a general audience and are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 through our Sites and Apps. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 online without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian, we will use all reasonable efforts to promptly delete such information.

As a convenience to our Site visitors and App users, our Services may contain links to third-party websites, apps and online services that we believe offer useful information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such third-party websites, apps or online services. We suggest reviewing the privacy notices or policies of such third parties or contacting them directly for more information on their privacy practices. Chewy is not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services, regardless of whether they are linked to or otherwise connected to our Services.
