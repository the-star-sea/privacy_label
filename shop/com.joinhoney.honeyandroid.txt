PayPal Honey's products include, but are not limited to, the PayPal Honey extension for web browsers (the “Extension”), the PayPal Honey mobile application (the “Mobile App”), and the website located at www.joinhoney.com (the “Website”). Honey Science LLC is a subsidiary of PayPal, Inc.To the extent that PayPal Honey has links to other websites (like retailers), please note that we do not own, operate, or control them, and they have their own controlling privacy policies that you should review.What data we collect and why
In order to provide our services, PayPal Honey collects information that you share directly with us when you use our website, extension, or Mobile App. Though you don't have to, you can choose to provide your email to set up an account with us, which lets you add items to your Droplist, earn Rewards, see a personalized recommendation feed, and more. You can also set up your profile with your name and other info for a more personalized experience.
PayPal Honey also collects technical information about your device and use of PayPal Honey to make sure that our products are working correctly. The information we collect is geared to providing PayPal Honey members with a better way to shop online and to help us develop, improve, and market our services.
Learn More
PayPal Honey does not track your search engine history, emails, or your browsing on any site that is not a retail website (a site where you can shop and make a purchase). When you are on a pre-approved retail site, to help you save money, PayPal Honey will collect information about that site that lets us know which coupons and promos to find for you. We may also collect information about pricing and availability of items, which we can share with the rest of the PayPal Honey community.Shopping and Usage Data.
On retail sites, PayPal Honey collects the name of the retailer, page views, and in some cases, product information that allows us to track price changes and update our product catalog. We may also collect information regarding your purchases on a retail site while using PayPal Honey (for example, the transaction value, and the fact that an order was completed or returned) for purposes including internal analytics, commission collection, and managing Rewards. The information you share, and we collect, enables us to improve our products and gives us insights about coupons, deals, pricing, and availability of retail items, which we can share with the rest of the PayPal Honey community. We may also use this information to understand your shopping history, merchant and shopping preferences to provide you with a more tailored, relevant experience or show sponsored product offers that may interest you.Aggregate and Anonymized Data
We may also use the information we collect in aggregate or otherwise anonymized form. This lets us look at interactions with our site and products generally and does not identify you or any specific person. We use this general data for research, development, marketing, analytics, and to enhance the shopping experience for the Honey community.What data we do not collect
We collect information that we believe can help us save our users time and money. This does not include, and we do not collect, any information from your search engine history, emails, or from websites that are not retail sites.
We also do not collect bank or credit card information (unless you expressly provide those to us when you make a purchase through PayPal Honey).
