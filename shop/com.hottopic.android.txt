If you choose to use the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) browser signal, you will only be opted out of online sales or sharing of Personal Information, and will need to turn it on for each browser you use.

Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.

XIII. DATA STORAGE, RETENTION, AND SECURITY
Any Personal Information we collect will be stored on servers in the United States and subject to the laws of the United States, where the data protection and other laws may differ from those of other countries. Your Personal Information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities or to respond to judicial process in the countries in which we operate.
We retain Personal Information in identifiable form only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce agreements and similar essential purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
We take precautions intended to help protect information that we process but no system or electronic data transmission is completely secure. Any transmission of your Personal Information is at your own risk and we expect that you will use appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Information.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials for the Services. We will treat access to the Services through your account credentials as authorized by you.
