End User Terms of Sale and Account
THE LEGAL AGREEMENTS SET OUT BELOW GOVERN YOUR USE OF SERVICES (SERVICES). The value of the Gift will be for the Gift Recipient as if that Gift Recipient had self-funded the stored value or received the Promotional Value, with the exception that if an account is closed with a balance remaining from a Gift, that amount shall be returned to the Giftors Funding Instrument. In the event PayRange receives notice of a court order or other legal process that affects your account, PayRange will give notice of efforts it shall make to comply with a court order or other legal process, unless the court order or other process directs that PayRange not provide you notice, in which case it wont (due to the court superseding any notice obligation PayRange has undertaken or agreed to under the terms of this Agreement). THE DISCLAIMING ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS IN THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED. You and PayRange each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and PayRange shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules and procedures, including the AAAs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PayRange will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. You agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, notices and disclosures (collectively, Communications) that we provide in connection with your PayRange account (Account) and your use of our services. You may also withdraw consent to receive an electronic copy of your IRS Form 1099, yet maintain electronic communications with us by requesting paper copies of the IRS form 1099 in the manner described above.
