California privacy rights. California and Virginia residents can also find additional information consistent with applicable state law on our State Privacy Rights page. With those disclaimers out of the way, heres our most important highlight:
Best Buys purpose is to enrich lives through technology. And we dont sell (as sell is traditionally defined) your personally identifiable information to anyone else. We use the term personally identifiable information in these highlights to mean information that identifies, or that can reasonably be linked to, an actual natural person (thats a real, named human being). This could be as part of your interactions with Best Buy personnel, such as at our retail stores or during in-home visits, or when you provide information via our digital properties such as websites or mobile apps. Sometimes we share information with suppliers and business partners for internal Best Buy uses. Finally, Best Buy comprises multiple corporations in the Best Buy family.
