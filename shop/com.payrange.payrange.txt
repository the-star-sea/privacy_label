THE LEGAL AGREEMENTS SET OUT BELOW GOVERN YOUR USE OF SERVICES (“SERVICES”). BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SALE AND ACCOUNT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.
1. ACCOUNT
In order to use the Services, you will be required to register for a PayRange account.
An Account may be made through such means as (i) you create an account on the website or through the app, which at a minimum you will be required to have a valid email address and password), (ii) log in through a social media site, where an account is created through information released from the social media site, (iii) an account is generated through the means of a gifting process, or (iv) any other way.
You may only maintain one account. Such maintenance requires, and you agree to, provide up to date complete and accurate information, maintain and promptly update your account information, and maintain your log in information and password.
You agree that such log in information is confidential, that you will keep it secure, and that you accept all risk associated with it, including unauthorized access to your account. Should your information become compromised suspect any security breaches related to the Services, you agree to immediately notify PayRange.
You agree you shall not, (and shall not authorize) any act or omission that would sublicense, loan, sell, assign, lease, rent, transfer, act as a service bureau, distribute or grant the same or similar rights in the Account provided by PayRange under this Agreement to any other person or entity without the prior written consent of PayRange. PayRange may assign these Terms of Use, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you.
The Services are not directed to children under 13. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that (1) you are 13 years of age or older, or (2) that you are using the services with the permission and under supervision a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. Our primary means of payment using this website is a credit card, which are not available to children under the age of 18, and generally may not be used by children without a parent or legal guardian who has given the child consent.
We will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any personally identifiable information from a child under 13, unless that Account was opened and registered by the respective child’s parent or guardian and has verified consent for the account. Please see our privacy policy for details.
The purchase, funding or loading of prepaid access or “stored value” onto a card, into an account or other instrumentality or the redeeming, transferring or loading of promotional value into an account or other instrumentality is governed by the PayRange Terms of Sale and Account. The use of the PayRange Website is governed by the website Terms and Conditions, with the download and use of the PayRange Mobile Application governed by the Mobile Application License Agreement. Your privacy concerns are governed by the PayRange Privacy Policy. These agreements and the terms therein subject to change at any time and in our sole discretion. You are encouraged to review the Agreements and terms when using the services and making purchases.
2. ACCOUNT BALANCES.
You need to have a positive account balance in order to use PayRange Services. You do not need to maintain a Balance in your Account. If you do hold a Balance, that Balance represents an unsecured claim against PayRange. Your Balance will be held in an account insured by the FDIC. PayRange will combine your Balance with the Balances of other Users. PayRange will own the interest or other earnings on pooled Balances.
If your Account has a negative Balance, PayRange may either charge the funding source you have on file associated with your PayRange account or deduct amounts you owe PayRange from money you subsequently add or receive into your Account. PayRange does not charge end users any fees for opening, maintaining, or deactivating a PayRange account. Other charges, for example, from your mobile phone service provider, may apply.
3. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT
You may deactivate your Account at any time by clicking the “deactivate” button in your Account Profile. Upon deactivation, you may request a refund back to the original payment source of any prepaid balance added within the last 90-days. Your unused prepaid balance is not refundable if added more than 90-days prior to your request for refund. PayRange accounts do not have expiration dates. If you reactivate your account at a later time, any unrefunded prepaid balance will be available again. You may not close your Account to evade a set off. If you do or we reasonably suspect that may happen, we may hold your Balance for up to 180 Days to protect PayRange, its affiliates, or a third party against the risk of Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability. You will remain liable for all obligations related to your Account even after the Account is closed.
4. PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUND POLICY
You agree that you will pay for or fund all of the value added to your PayRange Stored Value Account and you agree to pay for products and services you purchase through the Services, and that PayRange may charge your payment method for value added to your PayRange Stored Value Account and decrement your stored value account for any products purchased through the Services and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING PAYRANGE WITH A VALID PAYMENT METHOD FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. For details of how purchases or funding is billed please visit www.payrange.com/support.
Your total price will include the price of the product or service plus any applicable fees or taxes; any taxes (if applicable) will be based on the location of the purchase, and the sales tax rate in effect at the time you purchase a product. All sales of products are final. We will charge tax for funding an account only in states where required.
Prices for products offered via the Services may change at any time, and the Services do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by PayRange. If you use the PayRange Mobile Application, you agree that you are responsible for any and all fees charges and costs that your service provider charges for your mobile phone or mobile device service, such as fees for SMS, data services, other communications or other fees charged by your service provider. Your device service provider does not provide PayRange Services.
5. RECURRING PAYMENTS
Preapproved Payments. A Preapproved Payment is a payment that you authorize us to directly charge your Payment Method on a one-time or periodic (regular-timed, or occurrence/sporadic basis).
Preapproved Payments are sometimes called “subscriptions”, “recurring payments”, “preauthorized transfers” or “automatic payments.”
6. BILLING PROCESS
When you fund your PayRange account, your funding instrument or funding account (“Funding Instrument”) will be billed at the time of or shortly after your transaction. If you use a credit card or debit card account for a transaction, we may obtain preapproval for an amount up to the amount of the funding request or other purchase. All fees will be billed to the Funding Instrument you designate during the registration process. If you want to designate a different Funding Instrument or if there is a change in your Funding Instrument status, you must change your information online in the Account Information section of your account, and if you do not, it may temporarily disrupt your access to the Services while PayRange verifies your new payment information. At the time of purchase or after your transaction, your PayRange account will be funded in an amount equal to the value of the purchase, minus, if applicable, taxes and fees. The value of funds can be used only for goods or services (Stored Value, Allowances, Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates) in transactions involving the PayRange network.
7. STORED VALUE ACCOUNT, ALLOWANCES & PROMOTIONAL VALUE
You are participating in a stored value program as an End User who may use the PayRange Service to buy products, goods and services from one of a limited number of affiliated merchants. Your account will be funded on a prepaid basis, and able to be reloaded or funded up to $500 per loading or funding, but no account shall have the ability to hold more than $999 at any one time.
Stored Value, Allowances & Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates in addition to unused balances, are not redeemable for cash and cannot (except as required by law, and otherwise described in these Terms of Sale and Account) be returned for a cash refund; exchanged; resold; used to purchase Gifts or Gift Certificates; used to provide Allowances. Unused balances are not transferable. Stored Value, Allowances, Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates purchased in the United States may be redeemed through the Services only in the United States, its territories, and possessions. The Gift Certificate cash value is 1/10 of one cent.
PayRange shall be the Issuer of stored value and the Merchant of Record for that transaction. Stored Value, Allowances, Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates are issued and managed by PayRange (“Issuer”). When your PayRange Account is used for a transaction, the amount of that transaction is deducted from your PayRange account at the time of your transaction.
PayRange is not responsible for lost or stolen Stored Value, Allowances, Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates or lost or stolen usernames, passwords or mobile devices. Risk of loss and title for Stored Value, Allowances, Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates transmitted electronically pass to the purchaser upon electronic transmission to the recipient. Risk of loss for Stored Value, Allowances, Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates transmitted electronically pass upon electronic transmission from PayRange. For avoidance of doubt, such recipient may not always be you.
PayRange reserves the right to close accounts and request alternative forms of payment if Stored Values, Allowances, Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates are fraudulently obtained or used on the Service.
PAYRANGE AS ISSUER, AND ITS LICENSEES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO STORED VALUE, ALLOWANCES, PROMOTIONAL VALUE, GIFTS AND GIFT CERTIFICATES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN THE EVENT STORED VALUE, ALLOWANCES, PROMOTIONAL VALUE, GIFTS AND GIFT CERTIFICATES ARE NONFUNCTIONAL, YOUR SOLE REMEDY, AND OUR SOLE LIABILITY, SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF SUCH STORED VALUE, ALLOWANCES, PROMOTIONAL VALUE, GIFTS AND GIFT CERTIFICATES. THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.
8. PROMOTIONAL VALUE
PayRange Stored Value Accounts may have two or more separate values. All Stored Value Accounts will have the actual amount paid, and some accounts may have associated “Promotional Value” and “Gift Value.”
The “Promotional Value” is any additional value beyond the amount paid. For example, if there is a promotion where funding a stored value account has a ten percent increase, so that funding an actual amount paid value of $10 results in your Stored Value Account balance of $11 dollars, the Promotional Value is $1. The Promotional Value is not actual Stored Value, and is subject to different terms and conditions, most notably may expire on a pre-determined date or after a prescribed amount of time, unless prohibited by law. The Merchant is responsible for permitting you to redeem the Promotional Value for at least the amount paid, even after the promotional value has expired.
9. GIFTS
“Gift” is a generic term for products purchased from the Services or Stored Value funded into an account by someone other than end user. Gifts may be made up of Stored Value or Promotional Value. The value of the Gift will be for the Gift Recipient as if that Gift Recipient had self-funded the stored value or received the Promotional Value, with the exception that if an account is closed with a balance remaining from a Gift, that amount shall be returned to the Giftor’s Funding Instrument.
10. TERRITORY
Stored Value, Allowances, Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates may be purchased only for, and redeemed only by, persons in the United States, its territories, and possessions. Gift recipients must have compatible hardware and parental control settings to utilize some Gifts. Gifts and the Gifting function may not be available in some jurisdictions. PayRange is not responsible for typographic errors.
11. RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES.

PayRange, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to terminate this Agreement, access to its website, or access to the PayRange Services for any reason and at any time upon notice to you and payment to you of any unrestricted funds held in your Balance. If we find you have violated any part of the Restrictive Policy, we reserve the right to refuse to provide the PayRange Services to you in the future or take legal action against you, or both.
In the event PayRange receives notice of a court order or other legal process that affects your account, PayRange will give notice of efforts it shall make to comply with a court order or other legal process, unless the court order or other process directs that PayRange not provide you notice, in which case it won’t (due to the court superseding any notice obligation PayRange has undertaken or agreed to under the terms of this Agreement). PayRange has no duty or obligation to contest or appeal any such order or process.
12. UNAUTHORIZED ACTIVITY AND ERRORS
You should immediately notify PayRange if you believe there has been unauthorized activity or any error on your account, if your password has been lost or stolen or if your mobile device has been lost or stolen. For Errors or Unauthorized Transactions, you may write to PayRange, Attn: PayRange Support, 9600 NE Cascades Pkwy, Suite 280, Portland, OR 97220; send us an email at support@payrange.com or telephone PayRange Customer Service at (855) 856-6398. If you write to us, please provide us with the following information: a) your name and the email address registered to your Account, b) a description of any suspected errors with transactions and an explanation as to why you believe the transaction is incorrect or why you need more information to identify the transaction, and c) the dollar amount of any suspected Error or Unauthorized Transaction. After you notify us of any suspected Error or Unauthorized Transaction, or we otherwise learn of one, we will conduct an investigation to determine whether there has been an Error or Unauthorized Transaction that is eligible for refund. We will complete our investigation within 14 Days of the date we received your notification of the suspected Error or Unauthorized Transaction. In certain circumstances, we may need additional time to complete our investigation. If we determine that we need more time to complete our investigation, we may authorize you to create a separate account for use while the investigation is under way. We will inform you of our decision within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.
Results. If we determine that there was an error, we will promptly credit the full amount of the error into your Account within 1 Business Day of our determination. Or, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts. If we decide that there was not an error, we will include an explanation of our decision in our email to you. If you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your Account and notify you of the date and amount of the debit. You may request copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
PayRange Processing Errors. We will rectify any processing error that we discover. If the error results in funding less than the correct amount into your PayRange account, PayRange will credit your Account for the difference. If the error results in your receipt of more than the correct amount to which you are entitled, PayRange will debit the extra funds from your Account.
Types of Problems Covered. PayRange
may be able to assist you in the case you did not receive the item you paid for with PayRange – “Item Not Received” (INR), which is limited to where PayRange has logged information of a purchase that was made but the machine did not function properly to deliver the Item, or the item was lodged in the machine, and you have taken a picture of the item stuck in the machine, and you have photographic proof that the Item was not received. PayRange expressly disclaims all liability for items that were paid for, but not as described, intended or ordered. PayRange is not responsible for typographic errors or for Items incorrectly or mistakenly ordered by the User. In addition, PayRange is not responsible for items incorrectly delivered by the Operator. PayRange may, at its discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to escalate the Dispute to a Claim if the claim is under $5. PayRange may, at its discretion, limit or decline to credit a problem for a user that has a disproportionately large amount of Errors, Unauthorized Transactions and other problems. If you are unable to resolve a problem directly with PayRange, we may give you the contact information of the Operator.
Error In Funding. You may have credit card chargeback rights. Chargebacks may be filed up to 120 Days after the payment, depending on your issue. You may pursue a Dispute/Claim with PayRange, or you may contact your credit card company and pursue your Chargeback rights. You may not pursue both at the same time or seek a double recovery. If you have an open Dispute or Claim with PayRange, and you also file a Chargeback with your credit card company, PayRange will close your Dispute or Claim, and you will have to rely solely on your Chargeback rights. You understand that in order to claim an Item Not Received, you will take a photo of the undeliverable Item in the machine in order to process the claim. You also agree that if you have received a refund that you are not able to then file a chargeback.

Our goal is to learn about and address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.

Applicable Law. You agree that the laws of the State of Oregon, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and PayRange, except as otherwise stated in this Agreement.
Release of PayRange. If you have a dispute with one or more Users, or an Operator with whom we cannot assist, you release PayRange (our Affiliates, and our and their respective officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers) from any and all Claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections, whether statutory or otherwise that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release. The failure of PayRange to exercise in any respect any right or remedy provided for herein shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or a waiver, partial or complete, of any future breach or any other right or remedy hereunder.
State Agencies. In addition to reporting complaints against PayRange to us described above, if you are a California resident, you may be able to report complaints to the California Department of Financial Institutions at its toll-free telephone number, 1-800-622-0620, by e-mail at consumer.complaint@dfi.ca.gov, or by mail at Department of Financial Institutions, Consumer Services, 1810 13th Street, Sacramento, CA 95811. Florida residents may be able to contact the Florida Department of Financial Services in writing at 200 East Gaines Street, Tallahassee, Florida, 32399, or by telephone at 1-800-342-2762. If you are a California resident, you have a right to receive information and notices by email. To make such a request, you may do so my email or you may send a letter to us at the following address: PayRange Inc., 9600 NE Cascades Pkwy, Suite 280, Portland, OR 97220.
Class Action Waiver. YOU AND PAYRANGE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and PayRange each waive any right to a jury trial. You and PayRange also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
Agreement to Arbitrate. You and PayRange each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and PayRange shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PAYRANGE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER PAYRANGE USERS.
Arbitration Procedure. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s website at www.adr.org.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayRange users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayRange user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration will take place in Portland, Oregon.
We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. PayRange will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayRange will pay all filling, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by PayRange should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayRange will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PayRange will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PayRange for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PayRange on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.
Severability. With the exception of the provisions in the Class Action Waiver subsection of this section, if a court decides that any part of this Disputes section is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this section shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions in the Class Action Waiver is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the User Agreement, including all other provisions of this Section (Disputes with PayRange), will continue to apply.
Opt-Out Procedure. YYou can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate (“opt out”) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”). For new PayRange users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you accept this Agreement for the first time. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to PayRange, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 9600 NE Cascades Pkwy, Suite 280, Portland, OR 97220.
The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to this Agreement to Arbitrate and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayRange account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the Agreement, including all other provisions of this Section (Disputes with PayRange), will continue to apply. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us. If you agree to opt out of arbitration, you agree to settle all legal issues in the state and federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon.
17. Electronic Delivery of Communications.

PayRange Terms of Service
The Terms and Conditions described here constitute a legal agreement (“Agreement”) between the sole proprietor or business organization listed as the “Merchant” on the Service registration page (sometimes referred to as “you,” “your”, “user”) and PayRange, Inc. (referred as “PayRange,” “we”, “our” or “us”).
Section A: The PayRange Service
Our Role
Our Service helps you accept payments (collectively “Payments”) from your customers who want to pay you for products or services through a stored value account. PayRange is not a bank or a money services business (“MSB”) and PayRange does not offer banking or MSB services as defined by the United States Department of Treasury.
PayRange is a stored value platform. PayRange Stored Value may only be used with the PayRange Services through the PayRange Mobile Application, which services enable the purchase of products, goods and services from unattended automated terminals. An account is funded on a prepaid basis, and able to be reloaded or funded up to $500.00 per loading or funding, but no account shall have the ability to hold more than $999 at any one time.  Unused balances are not redeemable by PayRange or the Operator for cash and cannot (except as required by law, and otherwise described in these Terms of Sale and Account) be returned for a cash refund; exchanged; resold; used to purchase Gifts or Gift Certificates; or used to provide Allowances. Unused balances are not transferable. Stored Value, Allowances, Promotional Value, Gifts and Gift Certificates purchased in the United States may be redeemed through the Services only in the United States and its territories. In addition, PayRange does not assume any liability for the products or services purchased using our Service. You will be required to register with PayRange to use the Service (see Registering for PayRange).

Disabling or failing to properly use Security Controls increases your exposure to unauthorized transactions, and in such case, you would be responsible for the use of lost or stolen data that is used to purchase products or services from your business. PayRange will not be liable for losses resulting from use of that lost or stolen data with the Service.

If you are uncertain as to whether your business is a Prohibited Business, or have questions about how these requirements apply to you, please contact us.
Section C: Processing Sales Transactions and Receiving Your Funds
Processing Sales Transactions
As used herein, “Claim” means a challenge to a payment that you or an End User files directly with PayRange. “Reversal” means PayRange reverses the settlement of funds from a processed card transaction that you received because
(a) the settlement funds were sent to you in error by
PayRange or it’s bank;
the processors, suppliers or licensors of PayRange or it’s bank; or
any of the respective affiliates, agents, directors and employees of any of the entities listed in (i) or (ii) above,
(b) the sender of the payment did not have authorization to send the payment (for example: the End User used a card that did not belong to the End User),
(c) you received the payment for activities that violated this Agreement or any other PayRange agreement, or
(d) PayRange decided a Claim against you.
You will not impose any fee or surcharge on a customer that seeks to use the PayRange services, and you will maintain appropriate records of all Sales Transactions for a period of at least two (2) years from the date of the transaction.
Payouts and Transaction History
We will pay out settlement funds to your designated bank settlement account (“Bank Account”) you provided when establishing your PayRange Operator Account in the amounts actually received for each transaction less our Fees (as defined below), rounded to the penny, with the minimum charge of one cent  for sales transactions submitted to our Service.
The payouts will be made to this Bank Account.
This Bank Account must be located at bank branch in the United States and held in the name of the business.
You are responsible for the accuracy and correctness of information regarding your Bank Account.
Funds for any given transaction will not be transferred to your Bank Account until the transaction is deemed complete.
Transactions will be deemed complete when we have received funds settling from the End Users, when we or our processing financial institutions have accepted such funds, and the End User has purchased products and services from you.
The actual timing of the transfers to your Bank Account of the settling funds will be subject to the Payout Schedule (as defined below).
Any monthly fees will be charged to the Operator’s PayRange account on a weekly basis, netted from Operator’s weekly settlement, unless otherwise agreed to by PayRange
After each payout of stored value account settlement funds to your Bank Account, we will update information in your PayRange Operator Account to reflect settlement. Information regarding your Sales Transactions processed and settled with the Services (“Transaction History”) will be available to you when you login to our website using your PayRange Operator Account. We provide a minimum of one year of Transaction History on our website or upon request to PayRange. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your PayRange Operator Account, your Transaction History and your use of the Service. PayRange is not responsible for maintaining Transaction History or other records in a manner consistent with your record retention obligations.
Payout Schedule
Payout schedule refers to the time it takes for us to initiate a transfer to your designated Bank Account of settlement funds arising from Sales Transactions processed through the Service (“Payout Schedule”). Once your Bank Account information has been reviewed, PayRange will initiate transfer of settlement funds (net of Fees, Claims, and other funds owed to us for any reason) in accordance with the Payout Schedule, the terms of which will be made available to you when you log in to your PayRange Operator Interface.
Payouts for your sales transactions are typically sent to your bank weekly, on the Monday immediately following the previous period, from Monday to Sunday. The settlement funds are sent by Automated Clearing House (ACH) and should normally be credited to your Bank Account within 1-3 days of us initiating the payout.
We are not responsible for any action taken by the institution holding your Bank Account that may result in some or all of the funds not being credited to your Bank Account or not being made available to you. You can contact PayRange to inquire about changing the timing of your Payout Schedule. Upon submitting a request, you will be informed of the process and requirements for PayRange to review your Payout Schedule.
We reserve the right to change the Payout Schedule or suspend payouts to your Bank Account should we determine it is necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive refunds, or other suspicious activity associated with your use of the Service, or if required by law or court order.
Taxes and Reporting. As between you and us, unless we otherwise agree with you in writing or are otherwise required to do so by law, you are solely responsible for the filing of any tax disclosure forms associated with your receipt of funds or payment of funds to any recipient (including, e.g., 1099 forms). You will indemnify and hold PayRange harmless from any fines, penalties, or claims of any kind that result from your failure to do so.
Reconciliations and Errors
Your Transaction History will be available to you when you log in to the PayRange Operator Interface. Except as required by law, you are responsible for reconciling your Transaction History with your actual sales transactions. PayRange has the right but not the obligation to reconcile your transaction history. Each party agrees to notify the other of any discrepancies arising from such reconciliation and verification. We will investigate any reported or suspected discrepancies and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover. In the event you are owed money as a result of the discrepancy, we will transfer funds to your Bank Account in the next scheduled payout. In the event of a payout greater than the reconciliation, PayRange is authorized to net out overpayments until the discrepancy is covered. Any recurring charges or other negative balances may be charged to payment card on file or debited from Operator’s bank account, at the discretion of PayRange. Your failure to notify us of an error or discrepancy in your Transaction History within sixty (60) days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you in connection with any such error or discrepancy in processing your card payments.
If you submit or cause us to process sales transactions erroneously, you agree to contact us immediately. We will investigate any reported errors and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover by crediting or debiting your Bank Account as appropriate.
Refunds and Returns & Adjustments
By accepting these terms of service, you agree that PayRange is responsible for refunding and adjusting for purchases made through the Services, or amounts owed for the services and further agree to submit to PayRange any and all refunds and adjustments for returns of your products and services you receive from End Users that were made through the PayRange Service in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. We require that you will
maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy;
not give cash refunds to a customer in connection with a sale, unless required by law, and without notifying PayRange, and
not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a refund.
Full refunds shall be for the exact dollar amount of the original transaction including tax, handling charges, and other applicable charges and fees. The refund amount may not exceed the original sale amount except by an amount equal to any reimbursements to customer for postage costs incurred for product returns. Best efforts will be used to process all refunds within sixty (60) days after the original transaction date, refunds processed after that time may not be capable of being processed.
For processed refunds, PayRange will deduct the refund amount (including any applicable Fees) from settlement funds owed to you from processing of other Sales Transactions. If these funds are not sufficient, you authorize PayRange to initiate an ACH debit entry to your Bank Account in the amount necessary to complete the refund transaction to the cardholder’s card. In the event PayRange cannot access your Bank Account by means of ACH debit, you agree to pay all funds owed to PayRange upon demand. You are solely responsible for accepting and processing returns of your products and services; PayRange has no responsibility or obligation for processing such returns.
If PayRange discovers that the PayRange Services are charging for your goods and services at a rate higher or lower in the corresponding machine, PayRange will notify you of such discrepancy may either wait for instructions from you or immediately adjust the PayRange Application pricing to reflect the actual machine price (please see also Two Tier Pricing and Reconciliation and Errors).
Excessive Claims
At any point, PayRange, may determine that you are incurring excessive Claims. Excessive Claims may result in additional fees, penalties, or fines. Excessive Claims may also result in
(a) additional controls and restrictions to your use of the PayRange Service
(b) possible suspension or termination of your PayRange Operator Account and access to the Service.
PayRange Fees
You agree to pay the Fees (“Fees”) assessed by us to you for providing the payment services described in this Agreement. These fees will be calculated pursuant to the PayRange Fee (See per transaction fee under ‘Simple Pricing’) linked to this Agreement and incorporated into this Agreement by reference. We reserve the right to revise our Fees at any time, subject to a thirty (30) day notice period to you. You acknowledge that you are also responsible for any penalties or fines imposed on PayRange or directly to you by any Card Network or financial institution as a result of your activities.
Two-Tier Pricing
PayRange enables you to utilize a two-tier pricing structure with the PayRange Services to offer a discount for the use of cash. The standard PayRange Fee will be applied to and include any two-tier charges. A higher price for PayRange may not be positioned as an additional fee or PayRange two-tier charges. Any two-tier charges may not be more than the two-tier charges for any other cashless payment method on the machine. You may elect to implement a discount for using PayRange, and if so, you may state that it is a discount for using PayRange. If you elect to implement Two-Tier Pricing, the price difference must be expressed clearly at the point of sale so consumers understand there is a lower price for using cash on your vending machine, and that the alternative price is a lower or “discounted” vend price.
Signage / notice to be placed on vending machine:
“CASH PURCHASES ARE DISCOUNTED $_.__ PER ITEM”
By electing to use two-tiered pricing, you warrant that you have determined there is no prohibition, state, local or other, on such pricing structure, and you agree to indemnify and hold harmless PayRange for your implementation of a two-tiered pricing structure. If you fail to comply with the Two-Tier Pricing program feature rules, we reserve the right to suspend to cancel your ability to offer Two-Tier Pricing.

Disputes with PayRange.
You and PayRange agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section with PayRange). Please read this Section carefully. It affects your rights and will impact how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.
Please, Contact PayRange First If a dispute arises between you and PayRange or one of the Operators. Our goal is to learn about and address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Disputes between you and PayRange regarding the PayRange Services may be reported to Customer Service online through the PayRange Help Center at any time, or by calling (855)856-6398 from 8am to 5pm, pacific time.
Applicable Law. You agree that the laws of the State of Oregon, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and PayRange, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.
Class Action Waiver. YOU AND PAYRANGE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and PayRange each waive any right to a jury trial. You and PayRange also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights
Release of PayRange. If you have a dispute with one or more Users, or an Operator with whom we cannot assist, you release PayRange (our Affiliates, and our and their respective officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers) from any and all Claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections, whether statutory or otherwise that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release. The failure of PayRange to exercise in any respect any right or remedy provided for herein shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or a waiver, partial or complete, of any future breach or any other right or remedy hereunder.
State Agencies. In addition to reporting complaints against PayRange to us described above, if you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the California Department of Financial Institutions at its toll-free telephone number, 1-800-622-0620, by e-mail at consumer.complaint@dfi.ca.gov, or by mail at Department of Financial Institutions, Consumer Services, 1810 13th Street, Sacramento, CA 95811.

To make such a request, you may do so my email or you may send a letter to us at the following address: PayRange Inc., 9600 NE Cascades Pkwy, Suite 280, Portland, OR 97220.
Agreement to Arbitrate. You and PayRange each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and PayRange shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PAYRANGE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER PAYRANGE USERS.
Arbitration Procedure. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s website at www.adr.org.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayRange users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayRange user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration will take place in Portland, Oregon.
We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. PayRange will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayRange will pay all filling, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by PayRange should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayRange will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PayRange will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PayRange for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PayRange on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.
Severability. With the exception of the provisions in the Class Action Waiver subsection of this section, if a court decides that any part of this Disputes section is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this section shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions in the Class Action Waiver is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the User Agreement, including all other provisions of this Section (Disputes with PayRange), will continue to apply.
Opt-Out Procedure. You can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate (“opt out”) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”). For new PayRange users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you accept the User Agreement for the first time. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to PayRange, Inc., 9600 NE Cascades Pkwy, Suite 280, Portland, OR 97220.
The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to this Agreement to Arbitrate and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) or user name used to log in to the PayRange account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the User Agreement, including all other provisions of this Section (Disputes with PayRange), will continue to apply. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us. If you agree to opt out of arbitration, you agree to settle all legal issues in the state and federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon.

You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by writing to us at PayRange Inc., 9600 NE Cascades Pkwy, Suite 280, Portland, OR 97220, or, ironically, contacting us by email at info@payrange.com. You may also withdraw consent to receive an electronic copy of your IRS Form 1099, yet maintain electronic communications with us by requesting paper copies of the IRS form 1099 in the manner described above.
15. Requesting paper copies of electronic Communications. If you would like a paper copy of any Communication previously sent to you, you may contact us and make a request for a paper copy, up to 6 months after the date of the Communication. Requests made after 6 months may not be able to be met. Paper copies of Communications will be sent by first class US mail. In order for us to send you paper copies, you must have a current street address on file or provide it to us.
16. Maintaining Accurate Contact Information. For receiving electronic communications, you agree to keep the email address you give us to use to communicate with you up to date, complete and accurate. You agree to update your contact information when needed and acknowledge that if we do not have accurate contact information, we may not be able to communicate with you. For receiving any written, physical communications from PayRange, you must provider your complete and accurate physical address for receipt of US mail.
We may update our privacy policy. When such update is deemed material, we will post a notice describing the update as well as the update on our website.
