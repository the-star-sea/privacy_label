Other identifiable information
What we do
Why we do it
Why we need to do it (the legal stuff!)
We allocate you a unique number when you first shop with us (your customer ID)
This allows us to uniquely identify you
It’s an important part of our contract commitment to you
You don’t have to give us all of this personal information but if you don’t, you may not be able to buy from the site, and you are unlikely to receive our optimal overall customer experience. But that is your choice – and we respect that.
We also anonymise and/or aggregate personal information (so that it does not identify you) and use it for purposes including testing our IT systems, research, data analysis (for us and the brands sold through our site and app), improving our site and app, and developing new products and services.
Fraud prevention and detection
We use any of the above categories of information to identify, prevent and detect fraud, against either you or against ASOS. Detecting and preventing fraud is an unfortunate, butan absolutely essential part of our service and our contract commitment to you. Legally, we have to do this, and it is very important for us.
We also use Purchase history data, to protect our service and uphold our Terms of Service as part of our contract commitment to you, as part of this we may make use of computer-system decisions to protect ASOS and our Service. Your rights in relation to this are detailed below.
Personalising your ASOS experience
We use the data we collectto help us provide you with the best service, the best shopping experience and to show you the latest and greatest products and services that we think you will love.
Sharing your information
We share your data with the following categories of companies as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you:
Companies in the ASOS group, as sometimes different bits of our group are responsible for different activities
Companies that do things to get your purchases to you, such as payment service providers, warehouses, order packers, and delivery companies
Brand Partners that send purchases directly to you we'll make it clear if this applies when you place your order
Professional service providers, such as marketing agencies, advertising partners and website hosts, who help us run our business
Affiliates who help us reach out to potential new customers or promote our products on their websites
Credit reference agencies, law enforcement and fraud prevention agencies, so we can help tackle fraud
You may choose to take advantage of some of our additional services, in which case, depending on your choices we may share your data with the following categories of companies to fulfil the services you have asked for:
Social Media sites (for example if you choose to use a social media account to login to ASOS) and other companies approved by you
Product advisors to help you choose the right products
Marketplace sellers where you place a Marketplace order; and
Other third party payment providers, when you choose to use their payment services
If you would like to know more about the third-parties we may share personal data with, or how to find out more on how they will use your data, please contact us at the details below.
We do not, and will not, sell any personal data that directly identifies you to any third party. However, we may provide third parties such as our brand partners with information about our customers and their purchases. Before we do so, we will make sure that this information does not identify you, such as by aggregating it, anonymising it or removing personal identifiers from it.
Marketing messages
If you have said we can, we’ll send you marketing messages to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you see and find our products and services.
How to stop marketing messages from ASOS.com
You can control the marketing communications you receive from us through the Contact Preferences section of your ASOS account. You also have the following options:
Emails:  You can also click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any marketing email you receive, and this will take you to the Contact Preferences section of your account so you can unsubscribe from that method of communication.
Text Messages:  You can also text “stop” to the number provided within the communication and this will unsubscribe you from that method of communication.
Any method of Marketing:  You can contact our Customer Care team.  Once you do this, we will update our records to ensure that you don’t receive further marketing messages.
If you tell us you don’t want to receive marketing messages it might take a few days for all our systems to be updated, so we would ask for your patience as you might get messages from us while we process your request.
Please note that opting out of marketing messages will not stop service communications, such as order updates, or where you have asked for a specific ‘back in stock’ notification.
How to stop marketing messages from ASOS Marketplace
Marketplace has a separate system for marketing preferences to our main ASOS websites and apps. All ASOS Marketplace customers have the option to receive marketing communications from Marketplace and/or selected third parties.
If you decide you no longer want Marketplace marketing communications, you can opt out by visiting My Marketplace > My Details in the ASOS Marketplace website or you can click on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any Marketplace email.
