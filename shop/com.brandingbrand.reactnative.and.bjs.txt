collection of your location information, or when you grant us access to
your device’s GPS (like we request in the BJ’s mobile application). You
can stop us from collecting your device’s GPS by changing your Location
Services preferences. Even without your phone’s GPS information, we might
be able to approximate your location through other means, such as through
WiFi access points as described above.
INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, AND SIMILAR
TECHNOLOGIES
Cookies are pieces of information that any website may transfer to your
browser that are then stored in your computer’s system and that allow BJ’s
Sites to recognize you if you return to the Sites using the same computer
and browser. Web beacons, also known as “clear gifs,” “one–pixel gifs,”
“Internet tags” or “pixel tags,” are small graphic images (usually
invisible) that can be embedded in content and advertising on a website or
in an email. These may be embedded on BJ’s Sites or on advertisements for
BJ’s appearing on third–party websites or in email. Web beacons can
recognize certain types of information on your browser, check whether you
have viewed a web page or email message, and determine, among other
things, the time and date that you viewed the web beacon, the IP address
of your computer or device, and the URL of the web page from which the web
beacon was viewed.
We use these technologies to store users’ preferences and to record
information about your visit to BJ’s Sites. We also use these technologies
to customize advertising, web page content, and other offers or services
based on user profile information. Our use of cookies and web beacons may
enhance your experience with BJ’s by allowing us to save your preferences
for your next visit and better understand the products and services that
are relevant to you. We may also measure the general activity on BJ’s
Sites and measure advertising effectiveness, which allows us to determine
which areas and features are most popular. This information allows us to
make improvements to BJ’s Sites. We, and our third-party service
providers, may collect your email address using web beacons when you
interact with BJ’s Sites or our email advertising. However, web beacons do
not collect your name, postal address, credit card account information or
other personally identifying information.
Third parties may use “third–party” cookies to collect your information.
These third parties will use the information that they collect to deliver
advertisements about our products and services and those of third parties
that are customized to your preferences. These third parties may be online
advertising networks or other similar online intermediaries that collect
information through cookies and similar tools over time and across
different websites.
See the section titled What Choices Do I Have? for information on choices
available relating to our cookie usage and marketing activities.
INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER SOURCES
We may receive information about you from other sources such as third
parties to help us correct or supplement our records in order to better
promote relevant goods or services to you, provide you with innovative and
convenient products and services, deliver information about BJ’s
offerings, and to prevent or detect fraud or other illegal conduct. We may
also collect information that is publicly available, such as social media
profile information.
If you choose to link your social-media account or accounts relating to
other third-party services to your Membership or BJ’s Sites, WiFi, or
other services, you may be allowing those third parties to send us some of
your information, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use
what they send us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Our services sometimes direct you to third party websites for your
convenience and information. We do not control and are not responsible for
the privacy practices or the content of those sites. Access to any third
party websites is at your own risk and we will have no liability arising
out of or related to such websites and/or their content or for any damages
or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with any
purchase, use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services
available on or through any such third party websites.

delivery of Promotional Materials, to engage in data analytics, to offer
sweepstakes, contests, and other marketing, to advise you of upcoming
joint and co-branded promotional activities with BJ’s, or to conduct
research, subject to your right to opt out from sharing for marketing
purposes. See the section titled Choices Regarding the Use of My
Information below for information on exercising your right to opt out;
To our affiliates for their own
purposes;
As required by law, such as to
comply with a subpoena or other legal process, or to comply with
government reporting obligations;
When we believe in good faith that disclosure is proper
(a) to protect our rights, the integrity of our business, or your safety
or the safety of others, or (b) to detect, prevent, or respond to actual
or possible fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our
Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of our services;
In relation to a potential corporate transaction
to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or
other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation,
or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or
merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a
portion of our assets; and
otherwise with your consent.
We may share any categories of information described in What Information
Do We Collect? with the parties listed above. Except where stated
otherwise in this Privacy Policy, we may also generate and disclose to
third parties de-identified information or aggregate and de-identified
reports, such as reports on demographics and traffic patterns of users of
BJ’s Sites or visitors to our Clubs.
In some cases, our business partners may require, as a condition of
providing services to you, that you authorize them to share your
information with us. If we terminate our relationship with a third–party
business partner, we may provide that information to a new third party
offering the same or similar services.
Please note that when you interact with a third party, including our
Member Service Partners, those third parties’ privacy policies, not BJ’s,
govern any such third party’s use of the information they collect.
IS MY INFORMATION SECURE?
We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards
to protect the information we collect, maintain data accuracy, and use
information as authorized. However, no information system can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. When you establish an account at BJ’s, you
choose a password to help protect your account information. A password is
only as strong as you make it: you should select a unique password and
keep it safe. You may change your password as often as you wish by going
to My Account section of the BJ’s Sites.

Know, access, and confirm your Personal Information.
Delete the Personal Information we have about you, subject to exceptions
under applicable law.
Correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information.
Obtain your Personal Information in a portable and readily usable
format.
Opt-out of the use or processing of your Personal Information for

Opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information.
We will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of
your rights.
Certain state laws may also provide you the right to appeal our decisions
regarding your rights requests if we do not timely respond to your
requests or do not take action regarding your requests. Additionally, if
you are a resident of the state of California, you may have a right to
pursue legal action for improper handling of your Personal Information.
Submitting a Rights Request
If you wish to exercise the rights listed above, and are a resident of a
state that provides such privacy rights, you may submit a request by
emailing
privacyrequests@bjs.com or by
calling us at 800–BJS–CLUB (257–2582). We will provide your Personal

Rights Request” in the subject line and clearly provide us with the
following information: what type of request you are making, your full

We are required to provide you with access to your Personal Information or
delete Personal Information only in response to verifiable or
authenticated requests. We will compare the information you provide by
telephone or via email with any information we may have in our possession
in order to verify your request. We may also contact you to request

provide must match the information we have in our possession. This measure
is in place to help ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to
any person who does not have the right to receive it. The information
collected through this process will be used for verification purposes
only. Pursuant to your state’s privacy laws, you may request access to
your Personal Information a limited number of times within a 12-month
period.

Please note that you may authorize an agent to exercise any of these
rights on your behalf by contacting us by email at

perks for those: (1) who have a BJ’s Membership; (2) participants in our
cobrand credit card programs; and (3) participants in our other
promotions, programs or sweepstakes (“Programs”). Under California law, participating in any of our Programs may be

is optional and consumers may opt out at any time. In addition to this
disclosure, each Program contains terms specific to that promotion. Your
participation in any of these Programs will be considered affirmative
consent to the terms of that particular Program.
We offer these Programs to, among other things, enhance our relationship
with our customers. The value to our business, in the aggregate, of
customers’ Personal Information depends on specific facts, such as whether
and to what extent they take advantage of any offerings. We do not
calculate the value of customers’ information for our accounting
statements. To the extent we would, however, such valuation could be
directly or reasonably related to the cost associated with acquiring or
