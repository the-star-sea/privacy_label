Capital One Shopping is committed to your privacy. Our goal is to maintain your trust and confidence when handling personal and financial information about you.
This Capital One Shopping Online & Mobile Privacy Practices Policy (“Policy”) describes Capital One Shopping’s online and mobile privacy practices and applies to anyone who visits our website (www.capitaloneshopping.com), uses our browser extension or any of our mobile applications ([collectively, our “Services”]), or visits Capital One Shopping-branded social media sites or pages. The term “Capital One Shopping” or “we” or “us” or “our” in this Policy means Wikibuy Holdings, LLC.
Information that you provide to Capital One Shopping when you enroll in, use or obtain a product or service from us to be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes is also governed by a separate notice entitled Capital One Shopping Privacy Opt Out Notice. If you are such a customer, please refer to that notice for additional information about our privacy practices. In addition, the Capital One California Consumer Privacy Act Disclosure applies to certain information that we and other Capital One affiliates collect about California residents.
The Capital One Online Privacy Policy located at www.capitalone.com/privacy/online-privacy-policy does not cover the Capital One Shopping Services, but covers other Capital One websites not covered by this Capital One Shopping Privacy Policy. For example, if you visit or access your accounts from the www.capitalone.com site, please review the online privacy practices of that website to understand how your online information may be collected, used and shared.
By using any portion of our Services, you agree to the Terms of Service and conditions of this Policy. Please read them carefully.
Information We Collect
When you use our Services, we may collect data from you that generally falls into one of two categories:
“Personal Information” - Personally identifiable information you provide to us when you register for or use any Capital One Shopping service, website, or app. This information may include your name, email address, username and password, account access tokens, retail account log-in credentials, credit card information, phone number, billing address, mailing/shipping address, zip code, whether you have a Capital One account, or other information that identifies you.
If you grant inbox permission, we may collect your emails including but not limited to email header data (sender, recipient, date and subject), your transaction or purchase activity and details, travel-related bookings, purchase shipment history and details, and information about your use of coupons and other savings opportunities.
If you download and use our browser extension, we may collect browsing, product and e-commerce information, including but not limited to product pages viewed, pricing information, location data, purchase history on various merchant websites and services, the price you paid for items, whether a purchase was made, and the coupons that you used (including information regarding whether or not a coupon or coupon code is valid or effective). We may also collect information on coupons and other discounts that you found using our Services, even if you do not use such coupons, so that we may share this coupon and discount information with other users.
“Online/Mobile Activity Data” - Data such as your IP address, your browser type and language, and your display/screen settings; data about how you use our website and how you interact with our website and mobile advertisements; data about your mobile device; advertising identifiers; precise location data; social media preferences and other social media data; and other data that may be aggregated and/or de-identified (information that doesn’t identify individual consumers/customers).
How We Collect Information
When You Use or Visit Our Site
Capital One Shopping may collect information about you when you browse our Site or use our online Services. We may collect Personal Information when you voluntarily provide it to us through our website or in our mobile applications.
Capital One Shopping may also use cookies and other online tracking devices such as pixel tags and clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) to collect Online/Mobile Activity Data from you depending on your browser settings. Cookies are small text files that a website’s server places on your computer. Cookies provide a means for websites that you visit to track browsing activities conducted with your computer. A Web beacon is a small string of software code that represents a graphic image on a website or email.
Capital One Shopping may also partner with certain third parties to deliver advertisements and monitor activities on our own website and other websites. Our partners may also use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile statistics about website visitors.
When You Grant Inbox Access
Capital One Shopping may collect Personal Information when you provide us access credentials or tokens for your email and other merchant accounts.
Capital One Shopping systems capture email header data (sender, recipient, date and subject, not message bodies), in encrypted form. Capital One Shopping then applies proprietary logic to identify emails that: (1) appear to be receipts from retailers, online sellers, or merchants engaged in ecommerce (“Merchant(s)”) we monitor; or (2) relate to other potential savings opportunities. The bodies of these select emails are then retrieved, decrypted and reviewed to notify you of potential savings opportunities. Occasionally, we may also decrypt the email header data so that we can make sure our proprietary logic is working properly.
When You Use our Browser Extension
We may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear GIFs" or “web beacons.” This automatically-collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, web pages or sites that you visit, order information, the content you view or interact with on our Services, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use our Services. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you. We may obtain information from third parties and sources outside of Capital One Shopping, such as our partners, affiliates, and advertisers. This information may include, but is not limited to, order references.
When You Use Our Mobile Apps
Capital One Shopping may also use monitoring technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app.
Additionally, Capital One Shopping may collect Online/Mobile Activity Data when you access our mobile applications or use the browser on your mobile device to access our website. For example, if you have enabled location services on your mobile device, we may collect precise location data from your device.
When You Use Our Social Media Pages
Capital One Shopping has official pages on social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn and YouTube under the name Capital One Shopping that enables consumers and customers to discuss their experiences with Capital One Shopping products and services. We may also partner with companies that operate social media websites through which you may engage with Capital One Shopping. When you interact with us on social media websites we may collect information such as your likes, interests, feedback and preferences. When you interact with our partners, you are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. We may collect information from our social media partners, but only if you choose to share with them and they, in turn, share such information with us. Never include sensitive personal, financial or other confidential information such as your Social Security number, account number, phone number, mailing address or email address when posting or commenting online. Any posts you make on our official social media pages -- including posts that contain pictures, comments, suggestions, opinions, complaints or Personal Information -- are available to others who use those pages and are subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of the companies that operate the websites on which they appear. Please refer to the policies of those companies to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such posts. You are also subject to this Policy and these guidelines when you visit our official social media pages.
How We Use Information
We may use Personal Information and Online/Mobile Activity Data we have collected for a variety of reasons. For example, we may use this type of data:
to enable you to sign up for and use Capital One Shopping products or services and verify that your email address(es) and shopping account(s) are active and valid;
to verify your identity and/or location, to allow access to your accounts, to assist us in taking data security precautions, and to engage in fraud prevention/detection;
for business purposes, including data analysis, to improve, personalize, and optimize your website browsing and mobile application experiences by examining which parts of our website you visit or which aspect of our mobile applications you find most useful, and to improve existing or develop new products and services;
to send communications, including updates on promotions and events, relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties we work with;
to comply with federal, state or local laws, civil, criminal or regulatory investigations, or other legal requirements;
to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, or (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations;
to share with trusted third parties who are contractually obligated to keep such information confidential and to use it only to provide the services we have asked them to perform. Capital One Shopping does NOT share or sell your information with third parties for the third party’s own purposes such as marketing as described in the Capital One Shopping Privacy Opt Out Notice.
in connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, lease, or any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of Capital One Shopping assets, financing, disposal, conveyance or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company, or in the event of our bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or an assignment for the benefit of creditors. You expressly agree and consent to the use and/or transfer of the foregoing information in connection with any of the above described proceedings.
We may use email data we have collected (if inbox access is provided) for a variety of additional reasons. For example, we may use this type of data to:
provide Services to you, including monitoring your purchases, bookings, receipts, claims, and returns, and responding or updating you on inquiries or to contact you about your accounts;
initiate and facilitate claims on your behalf as your agent, and communicate with you and third parties about your claims; and/or
recommend savings opportunities on future purchases based on purchase behavior at monitored Merchants.
We may use browser data we have collected (if browser extension is downloaded) for a variety of additional reasons. For example, we may use this type of data:
to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users;
to improve Capital One Shopping and to develop new products, services, features, and functionality;
to provide customized advertisements, content, and information;
to monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Capital One Shopping and third-party marketing activities;
to track your entries, submissions, status in any promotions or other activities on or through Capital One Shopping.
Managing Your Online and Mobile Preferences
You provide Personal Information to us on a voluntary basis and are not required to provide it in order to browse our website. If you provide us with Personal Information to obtain a product or service from us, our Capital One Shopping Privacy Opt Out Notice will govern how we share your Personal Inf ormation.
Online Tracking & Advertising on our Site or Apps
As you access our online Services over time, cookies and similar technologies such as web beacons allow us to collect information such as browser type, pages visited, preferences, and your relationship with us. Capital One Shopping may customize content and advertisements for our products and services on the website or mobile apps we own. In order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, we may use information about your relationship with us (such as your purchase history). Currently, for online advertising purposes, our website does not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but these signals may be used for fraud prevention. However, if you choose, you can set your website browser to inform you when cookies are sent or you may choose not to accept cookies. Your decision not to accept cookies could limit access to some of the services and offers that are available on our website. For example, your device may not be recognized when you visit our website. You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that may be of interest to you.
We use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data and analyze your use of our Services. We also use Google reCAPTCHA to protect pages on capitaloneshopping.com. Both of these services are subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Google Terms of Service. Google provides some additional privacy options described at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.
Mobile Devices
Some mobile devices come with a non-permanent advertising identifier or ID which gives companies the ability to serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device. In many cases, you can turn off mobile device ad tracking or you can reset the advertising identifier at any time within your mobile device privacy settings. You may also choose to turn off location tracking on your mobile device. By turning off ad tracking or location tracking on your mobile device, you may still see the same number of ads as before, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests.
Behavioral Advertising on Third Party Sites
Certain Capital One Shopping partners may use unique cookies to collect Mobile/Online Activity Data on our website or mobile applications to advertise on third party websites Capital One Shopping products and services that may be of interest to you. Our partners are subject to their own privacy policies. If you prefer that our partners not display such advertisements to you, you may opt out by visiting http://optout.aboutads.info/choices or by clicking on the AdChoices icon in an advertisement and following the instructions. You may also opt out of receiving behavioral ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) Opt-Out Tool (http://optout.networkadvertising.org). or other tools provided by the publishing platform. Opting out relies on information in the unique cookies placed on your web browser by our partners, so if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again. Additionally, we may partner with websites like Google and Yahoo to display ads to you based on search terms you use on those websites. Please review the privacy policies of those websites for instructions on how to limit these ads.
Please note that you may still receive general online advertising from Capital One Shopping even after you adjust your ad preferences with certain web search engines or opt out of online advertising through AdChoices or the NAI tool. Such advertising, however, will not be based on Online/Mobile Activity Data or search term information.
Email
If we send you an email advertisement, it will include instructions on how to opt out of receiving such emails in the future. If you are a customer and you elect to opt out of receiving email advertisements, we may still send you emails about your Capital One Shopping account. To opt out of receiving email advertisements, you may submit your request to [email protected]. If your name was previously selected for any of our upcoming email offers, it is possible for you to receive information from Capital One Shopping up to 10 business days after your request has been submitted. If you receive an email that claims to be from us but you are not sure, or if you think it is suspicious, do not click on any of the links in the email. Instead forward it to us at [email protected] then delete it.
Push Notifications
You may opt out of push notifications or in-app messages at any time by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device settings.
Updating Your Information
Keeping your account information up-to-date is very important. You may access, review, update, correct or delete certain account information or close your account by logging into your account online. If you cannot change the incorrect information online, please contact us at [email protected]. We may retain cached or archived copied information about you for a certain period of time and as required by applicable law.
Protecting Children’s Online Privacy
Capital One Shopping encourages protection of children’s information on the internet. Our service is not intended for, nor targeted toward, children under the age of thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from children under age thirteen (13). If you are a child under the age of thirteen (13), you are not permitted to use our Services and should not send any information about yourself to us through the Services.

Data protection laws in the United States may be different from those of your country of residence.

Changes to this Policy
This Policy describes Capital One Shopping’s current online privacy practices. Capital One Shopping may change its online privacy practices in the future and we may revise this Policy to reflect material changes.
