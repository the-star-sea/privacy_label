Details of our Data Protection Officer responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy notice, and our
details are set out in the “How to Contact Us” section at the end of this notice.

We take the protection of your personal data seriously and will process your personal data fairly, lawfully and
transparently. This privacy notice describes the personal data we are collecting about you and how it is used.

How we keep your data safe and secure
We have appropriate organisational safeguards and security measures in place to protect your data from being accidentally

The legal basis for processing your personal data
We will only collect and process your personal data where we have a legal basis to do so. As a data controller, the legal
basis for our collection and use of your personal data varies depending on the manner and purpose for which we collected
it.
We will only collect personal data from you when:

Marketing preferences, adverts and cookies
Marketing - your preferences
We may send you marketing communications and promotional offers:
if you have opened an account with us or purchased goods from us, or registered for a promotion or event, and you
have not opted out of receiving that marketing (in accordance with your preferences, as explained below);
by email if you have signed up for email newsletters;
if you have provided us with your details when you entered a competition and you have consented to receiving such
marketing (in accordance with your preferences, as explained below).
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Transactional, Usage, Profile Data and Marketing and Communications Data to
form a view on what we think you may like, or what may be of interest to you, and to send you details of products and
offers which may be relevant for you.
We will ask you for your preferences in relation to receiving marketing communications by email, post, SMS and other
communication channels.
From time to time we may also include with your order, inserts advertising goods, services or offers from other
third-party companies that you may be interested in.
In respect of third party marketing communications, we will obtain your express opt-in consent before we share your
personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
You will always have full control of your marketing preferences. If you do not wish to continue receiving marketing
information from us (or any third party, if applicable) at any time:
you can unsubscribe or ‘opt-out’ by using the unsubscribe button and following the link included in the
footer of any marketing email; or
account holders may withdraw their consent by simply logging in to My Account
and editing your ‘Contact Preferences’.
We will process all opt-out requests as soon as possible, but please note that due to the nature of our IT systems and
servers it may take a few days for any opt-out request to be implemented.

Online ads
We use online advertising to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you find our products. Like many
companies, we may target boohoo banners and ads to you when you use other websites and apps, based on your Contact,
Technical, Usage and Profile Data. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and a
range of advertising technologies such as web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as
specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook’s Custom Audience Service.
Our use of analytics and targeted advertising tools
We use a range of analytics and targeted advertising tools to display relevant website content on our website and online
advertisements on other websites and apps (as described above) to you, deliver relevant content to you in marketing
communications (where applicable), and to measure the effectiveness of the advertising provided. For example, we use
tools such as Google Analytics to analyse Google's interest-based advertising data and/or third-party audience data

Your data and countries outside of Europe
The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic
Area ("EEA") using legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. It may also be processed by
staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other
things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We
will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.
Whenever we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by
ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. This may include using specific contractual clauses
approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as it has in Europe. More information
about these is available here http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087
Please contact us if you want further information on the countries to which we may transfer personal data and the
specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside the EEA.
Your Rights
You have several rights under the data privacy legislation. This includes, under certain circumstances, the right to:
request access to your personal data
request correction of your personal data
request erasure of your personal data
request restriction of processing of your personal data
request the transfer of your personal data
object to processing of your personal data
request human intervention for automated decision making
Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email
us at [email protected].
Request access to your personal data
You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain information relating to our
processing of your personal data.
Request correction of your personal data
You are entitled to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can update your personal
data at any time by logging into your account and updating your details directly, or
by emailing us at [email protected].
Request erasure of your personal data
This enables you to request that boohoo delete your personal data, where there is no good reason for us continuing to
process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal
reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Request restriction of processing of your personal data
You have a right to ask boohoo to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if you
want us to establish the accuracy of the data, or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify
whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Where processing is restricted, we are allowed to retain
sufficient information about you to ensure that the restriction is respected in future.
Request the transfer of your personal data
You have the right to obtain a digital copy of your personal data or request the transfer of your personal data to
another company. Please note though that this right only applies to automated data which you initially provided consent
for us to use or where we used the data to perform a contract with you.
Object to processing of your personal data
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we believe we have a legitimate interest in
processing it (as explained above). You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct
marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your data
which override your rights and freedoms.
Request human intervention for automated decision making and profiling
You have the right to request human intervention where we are carrying out automated decision making when processing your
personal data. This form of processing is permitted where it is necessary as part of our contract with you, providing
that appropriate safeguards are in place or your explicit consent has been obtained.
We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if
your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep
you updated. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
to exercise any of the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any
person who has no right to receive it.
Right to lodge a complaint
If you have any concerns or complaints regarding the way in which we process your data, please email us directly at
[email protected] You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK). We
would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please do contact us in
the first instance.
Changes to this privacy notice
From time to time we may change this privacy notice. If there are any significant changes we will post updates on our
website, applications or let you know by email.
How to contact us
We welcome feedback and are happy to answer any questions you may have about your data.
Please send any questions, comments or requests for more information to our nominated representative and Data Protection, who can be contacted at [email protected].
