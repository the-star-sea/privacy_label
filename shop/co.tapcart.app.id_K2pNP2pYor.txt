YOUR RIGHTS & CHOICES

You may choose to provide us with your email address for the purpose of allowing us to send free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to you, as well as targeted offers from third parties. You can stop receiving promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in emails that you receive. If you decide not to receive promotional emails, we may still send you service related communications.- Promotional Mailings. If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by emailing us (our contact information is below) with "NO SNAIL MAIL" in the subject line along with your name, address and zip code. Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed.- Promotional Text Messages. You can opt-out of receiving text messages from us by replying “STOP” to the text message you receive from us. Please note that this will only opt you out of the specific text messaging program associate with that number.- Changes To Your Personal Information. We rely on you to update and correct your personal information. Most of our websites allow you to modify or delete your account profile. Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law. If our website does not permit you to update or correct certain information contact us at the address described below.- Deletion Of Your Personal Information. Typically we retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. You may, however, request that we delete your personal information by following the process described below. If required by law, we will grant your request to delete information. However, when we delete personal information it will be removed from our active database, but it may remain in archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it. In addition, we may keep your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce any of our agreements.- Objection to Certain Processing. You may object to our use of your personal information by contacting us at the address described below.- Access To Your Personal Information.
You have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, along with other information such as the purposes of the processing, the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal information has been or will be disclosed, the sources of the personal information, retention, and transfers of personal information. If required by law, upon request, we will grant you with reasonable access to the personal information that have about you. Where required by law, we may also transfer a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice.- Online Tracking. Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus for how to recognize or respond to a DNT signal. For these reasons, New Era does not currently respond to DNT signals. New Era will endeavor to recognize commercially recognized opt out signals (e.g., Global Privacy Control). Recognition of this signal will only take place with respect to the device and/or browser that communicates the signal.- Do Not Sell My Personal Information. Subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the right to opt out of the "sale"/”sharing” of their personal information. It may be considered a “sale”/”sharing” of personal information under California law when we disclose your email address to the sports leagues we partner with. We and our licensing partners use that information to deliver offers, products and promotions that may be of interest to you. Also, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer personal information to business partners for their use. Making personal information (such as online/device identifiers, browsing activity, or geolocation) available to these third parties may be considered a “share” under the CCPA. To opt out of the "sale"/”sharing” of your personal information as just described, please click the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link at the bottom of our website or visit our Privacy Requests page.- Automated Processing: Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object to a significant decision based solely on automated processing (i.e., without human intervention) unless that decision is required or authorized by law.- Right of Non-Discrimination/Retaliation: We do not discriminate against individuals who exercise any of their rights described in this Privacy Policy, nor do we retaliate against individuals who exercise these rights.
- Right to Opt Out of our Use of your Sensitive Personal Information (in certain instances and if permissible under applicable law). We do not disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those which cannot be limited under applicable law.Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations.
Your rights and our responses will vary based on the circumstances of the request.
If you choose to assert any of these rights under applicable law, we will respond within the time period prescribed by such law.If you are located in the State of California in the United States, a person authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable request related to your personal information.
If you designate an authorized person to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf, we will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf. In any circumstances, your request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative of that person; and (ii) describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

In addition, New Era does not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under the age of 16.• Changes To This Privacy Policy. We may change our privacy policy and practices over time. To the extent that our policy changes in a material way, the policy that was in place at the time that you submitted personal information to us will generally govern that information. Our privacy policy includes an “effective” and “last updated” date. The effective date refers to the date that the current version took effect. The last updated date refers to the date that the current version was last substantively modified.
