Disputes
UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU MUST PROVIDE NOTICE TO
RALPH LAUREN, PURSUANT TO THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, OF ANY CLAIM WITHIN ONE YEAR OF ITS ACCRUAL OR YOUR
CLAIM SHALL BE WAIVED AND TIME-BARRED.
For purposes of the dispute resolution provisions in these Terms of Use, “Ralph Lauren” shall include its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
successors and assigns. Ralph Lauren and you agree arbitrate all disputes and
claims between you and Ralph Lauren, except for claims arising from bodily injury or death
(“Dispute”). Dispute shall be broadly interpreted and shall include but not be limited to: (1)
claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Ralph Lauren, whether based in contract, tort, fraud,
misrepresentation, or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; (2) claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising; (3) claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of bodily injury; (4) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (5) claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have a Dispute heard in small claims
court, which shall seek only individualized relief, so long as the action remains in that court and
is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This election may be made at any
time prior to the appointment of an arbitrator. Each party retains the right to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
patents, or other intellectual property rights. In addition, each party retains the right to
bring issues to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies.
This agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration
Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1–16, and federal arbitration law apply and govern the
interpretation and enforcement of the dispute resolution provisions in these Terms of Use.
The dispute resolution provisions shall survive termination of the Terms of Use.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
Commencing DIsputes
Prior to commencing an arbitration proceeding, you must first send a describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808, with a copy sent by email to RL-Legal@ralphlauren.com Notice”). The Notice must include your name, address, telephone number, email address, sufficient information for Ralph Lauren to identify any transaction at issue; and a detailed description of (1) your Dispute, (2) the nature and basis of your claims, and (3) the nature and basis of the relief sought. You must personally sign the letter. You and Ralph Lauren agree to negotiate in good faith about the Dispute, including through an informal and individualized telephone conference should Ralph Lauren request one. You must personally appear at and participate in the telephone conference (if you are represented by counsel, your counsel may also participate). This process should lead to resolution of the Dispute, but if for some reason it is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you may commence an arbitration. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. A court shall have the authority to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations without first providing a fully complete Notice and participating in this informal dispute resolution process. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any arbitration unless the claimant has complied with the Notice and informal dispute resolution process.
Arbitrations shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) as modified by the version of this
arbitration provision that is in effect when a party commences an arbitration proceeding with AAA. You can obtain the AAA Rules from the AAA by visiting its website (www.adr.org) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879). The party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the AAA by visiting its website or calling its toll-free number. You may deliver any required or desired notice to Ralph Lauren by mail to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808, with a copy sent by email to
RL-Legal@ralphlauren.com. If there is a conflict between these dispute resolution provisions and the AAA Rules, these dispute resolution provisions shall govern. If AAA will not administer a proceeding under these dispute resolution provisions as written, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under these dispute resolution provisions as written.
Payment of filing and other fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of a claim, counterclaim, or relief sought in connection with the arbitration was frivolous or was brought for harassment or an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), either party will have the right to recover its arbitration fees and expenses. In addressing its determination, the arbitrator may consider, among other things, whether a party previously offered full relief to the other party, including, but not limited to, a full refund of the sum paid for items purchased. In addition, the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator.
Each of us may incur attorneys’ fees during the arbitration. Each of us will bear our own attorneys’ fees, except in the following circumstances. If applicable law permits a prevailing party to recover attorneys’ fees, the prevailing party may seek fees as applicable law permits.
The Arbitration
The arbitration will be conducted by one neutral arbitrator selected with the participation and involvement of both parties pursuant to the AAARules.
if your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may elect that the dispute be resolved without an oral hearing, unless the arbitrator requests otherwise. Notwithstanding the forgoing, if requested by Ralph Lauren, you agree to personally appear (along with your counsel if you are represented) at an individualized telephone conference with a case manager before an arbitrator is appointed. Any in-person shall take place in the location of your county of residence
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement as a court would be. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except for specific issues otherwise provided elsewhere in these dispute resolution provisions and issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration, which shall be for the court to decide. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall be binding only among the Parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals.
Class Action Waiver; No Consolidation of Arbitral Claims
The parties agree that the arbitrator may award the same damages and relief (including declaratory or injunctive relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party to the proceeding or order Ralph Lauren to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless Ralph Lauren explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE LITIGATED OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS CLAIMS AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF). UNLESS BOTH YOU AND RALPH LAUREN OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
This class action and collective relief waiver is an essential part of this arbitration agreement and, if it is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief, neither you nor Ralph Lauren is entitled to arbitration of such claim or request for relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation is found to be unenforceable as to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), then the parties agree that such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.
Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration
If 25 or more individuals submit Notices or attempt to initiate arbitrations with Ralph Lauren raising similar claims, and counsel for the individuals bringing the claims are the same or coordinated for these individuals (“Mass Claims”), you and Ralph Lauren agree that if the claims are not resolved and proceed to arbitration, they shall proceed in staged bellwether proceedings. You understand and agree that if you choose to initiate your claim as part of Mass Claims, the adjudication of your claim might be delayed. Counsel for the individuals and counsel for Ralph Lauren shall each select ten cases (per side) to be filed in and proceed in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding to be resolved individually. Each case shall be assigned to a separate arbitrator. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed in arbitration, and the AAA shall not accept or administer arbitrations commenced in violation of these procedures. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the first stage bellwether proceeding, each side may select another ten cases (per side) to be filed in and proceed in arbitration in a second bellwether proceeding to be resolved individually. Each case shall be assigned to a separate arbitrator. This process shall continue until the parties are able to resolve all of the Mass Claims, either through settlement or arbitration. If these mass arbitration procedures apply to a claimant’s Notice, any statute of limitations applicable to the claims set forth in that Notice will be tolled from the time the first cases are selected for a bellwether proceeding until the claimant’s Notice is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court will have the authority to enforce these mass arbitration procedures and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations.
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, if Ralph Lauren makes any future changes to these dispute resolution provisions of these Terms of Use (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change by email to RL-Legal@ralphlauren.com. This is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of these dispute resolution provisions.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial to the fullest extent permitted by law and we each irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New York County, New York.
Changes to These Terms of Use
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use at any time by posting revised terms on the Site. It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we may make to these Terms of Use. You will have been deemed to have accepted any changes by, among other things, your continued access or use of this Site following the posting of changes to these Terms of Use or other policies.
In the event we make material changes to the Terms of Use, notice of these changes will be posted on the homepage of this website and the revised Terms of Use will take effect 30 days after their publication on this Site.
No waiver of any of the provisions of these Terms of Use will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other provision of these Terms of Use.
Entire Agreement and Admissibility
This agreement and any policies or operating rules posted on this Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and Ralph Lauren with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. A printed version of these Terms of Use shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based on or relating to use of the Site to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
Severability
Except as otherwise provided herein, if any provision of this agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the agreement will remain in place.

Operating Standards
Operating Standards
OPERATING STANDARDS
RALPH LAUREN CORPORATION and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively referred to herein as “RLC” or the “Company”) is dedicated to global citizenship and sustainability, and we expect the factories, subcontractors, distributors, manufacturers, business partners, service providers, suppliers and agents who are affiliated with the production of Ralph Lauren goods (collectively, “Suppliers”) to share in these commitments. RLC does not own the factories making its products or employ the employees in those factories, so it is essential that our Suppliers assume direct responsibility for protecting the environment and championing better lives for their employees. To that end, we require all Suppliers to observe certain operational standards set forth herein (“Standards”) for a safe, sustainable, inclusive, and ethical workplace that embraces a fundamental effort toward continuous improvement.
LEGAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS
We expect our Suppliers to observe all applicable local and national laws as well as international regulations and standards in the operation of their business. While we recognize the different legal and cultural environments in which Suppliers operate, we expect them to align with our Standards even when they offer greater protections than those imposed by local, regional, and national laws.
Anti-Bribery/Conflict of Interest – Suppliers must not engage in offering or accepting compensation of any value (such as gifts, discounts, services, loans, payments), either directly or indirectly, to or from any of the Company’s employees, service providers or to any government or political officials, to obtain an unfair or improper advantage. Suppliers shall also avoid any form of fraud or any action that creates, or appears to create, a conflict of interest with the Company.
Subcontracting – Suppliers are prohibited from subcontracting with unapproved suppliers for manufacturing or services and are responsible for ensuring that their subcontractors are held accountable to these Standards. Suppliers are only permitted to use homework with prior written consent and approval by the Company.
International Trade Compliance – Suppliers must comply with all applicable international laws relating to the import and export of products and are expected to participate in the Company’s Supply Chain Security program.
Transparent Record Keeping – Suppliers must maintain and make immediately available for inspection accurate records.
LABOR, HUMAN RIGHTS & SAFETY
Employment Relationships & Responsible Recruitment – Circumventing national or local laws to avoid regular employee entitlements such as benefits, wages or other legal obligations is prohibited. Suppliers will ensure no fee recruitment, no withholding of work/travel documents, and no restrictions on freedom of movement. When applicable, Suppliers will inform their employees of the basic terms of their employment before leaving home.
Wages and Benefits – Suppliers’ wage and benefit policies must be consistent with and comply with all laws regulating local wages, overtime compensation, and legally mandated benefits. Wages must also be paid timely and include a wage calculation for each pay period, as provided for under applicable law. Suppliers should provide compensation that is sufficient to meet workers’ basic needs and provide some discretionary income. If compensation does not meet workers’ basic needs and provide some discretionary income, Suppliers should work with RLC to make improvements to progressively realize a level of compensation that does meet these standards.
Working Hours – All regular and overtime hours must be voluntary and in accordance with national laws. Under ordinary business circumstances, employees must not be required to work excessive working hours and overtime and have at least one day off in seven.
Health & Safety – Suppliers will ensure that their employees are provided a safe and healthy work environment and are not subject to unsanitary or hazardous living or working conditions. Supplier-provided housing facilities shall be in a separate building. Every Supplier must obtain, maintain, and comply with all safety and health permits, including but not limited to, an obligation to ensure building integrity and fire safety with regularly scheduled emergency practice evacuations and frequent inspection of exit doors for proper emergency use.
No Child Labor – Use of child labor is prohibited (employees under the age of 16). Supplier employees between the ages of 16 and 18 must not be subject to night and/or hazardous work.
Freedom of Association & Collective Bargaining – Suppliers should permit their employees the right to associate with others, form and join (or choose not to join) organizations of their choice, and bargain collectively in accordance with applicable law, without risk of discrimination, harassment, interference, or retaliation, subject to applicable domestic law and practice. Where the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining is restricted under law, the Supplier must engage in their best efforts to otherwise comply with these principles.
Voluntary Employment – Suppliers are prohibited from working with or arranging for purchase of any materials or services that supports or utilizes forced, indentured, bonded, or compulsory labor obtained through human trafficking, coercion, or slavery.
