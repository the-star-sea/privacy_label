During the 12-month period prior to the last update of this California Residents Privacy Addendum, we have collected the personal information listed in the "What Information Do We Collect, How Do We Collect It, And How Do We Use It?" section of the Privacy Notice.
We do not collect or process sensitive personal information for purposes of inferring characteristics about consumers.
To the extent we process deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information unless permitted by applicable law.
Disclosure of Personal Information
In the table below, we explain the categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties for a business purpose during the 12-month period prior to the last update of this California Residents Privacy Addendum, and the categories of third-party recipients.
What We Disclosed
Who We Disclosed It To
Identifiers, including your first and last name, billing address, mailing address, phone number, email address, and internet protocol (IP) address;
We disclosed this information to:
order management and shipping processors;

In addition to the categories of third parties identified above, during the 12-month period prior to the Last Updated date of this California Residents Privacy Addendum, we may have disclosed personal information about you to government entities and third parties in connection with corporate transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions or divestitures.
Financial Incentive
We offer certain loyalty and rewards programs that may be considered financial incentives under California law, such as the e.l.f. Beauty Squad Loyalty Program, the Soulcare Rewards Loyalty Program, and exclusive offers and promotions via email. When you sign up for and participate in these programs, we may ask you to provide us with contact information and identifiers such as your name and email address, and commercial information such as your purchase history. Participation in these programs is voluntary and no purchase is required to become a member of the Beauty Squad Loyalty Program (you can join the Beauty Squad Loyalty Program here and review the terms of the Soulcare Rewards Loyalty Program here) or the Soulcare Rewards Loyalty Program (you can join the Soulcare Rewards Loyalty Program here and review the terms of the Beauty Squad Loyalty Program here). While we cannot calculate the precise value of your information, our programs generally reflect the value of the relationships that we have with the individuals who participate in them. You may withdraw from our loyalty programs at any time by contacting us using the designated method set forth in the applicable rules, such as by closing your account or opting out from our email and SMS communications.
Sale or Sharing of Personal Information
We do not sell your personal information for monetary compensation. However, like most online businesses, we share some information with advertisers, advertising publishers, and marketing service providers to serve you targeted advertising (including cross-device marketing or advertising campaigns (where we can infer that a particular browser, device, or pseudonymous identifier belongs to you)). These third parties may collect personal information via automated technologies on our websites for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. This kind of sharing may be considered a “sale” of personal information under California law when the personal information is exchanged for non-monetary consideration.
We may sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes (and, during the 12-month period prior to the last update of this California Residents Privacy Addendum, we may have sold or shared) the following categories of personal information with these third parties:
email address, phone number, IP address and internet and electronic network activity including information regarding interactions with our website.
You have the right to opt out of this disclosure of your personal information. If you wish to request that we do not sell or share your personal information, please contact us using the contact information detailed in the “Exercising Your California Privacy Rights” section of this California Residents Privacy Addendum.
We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share personal information of individuals that are California residents under the age of 16.
Retention of Personal Information
We will retain your personal information for the time period reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Notice and California Residents Privacy Addendum, or any other notice provided at the time of collection, taking into account applicable statutes of limitation and records retention requirements under applicable law.
CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
You have certain choices regarding your personal information, as described below.
Access: You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed, and sold or shared about you.
Correction: You have the right to request that we correct the personal information we maintain about you, if that information is inaccurate.
Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.
Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information or the sharing of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes.
If you choose to exercise any of your rights under California law, we will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of these rights.
Other California Privacy Rights
Shine the Light Requests.
California law permits our consumers who are California residents to request certain information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. This request is free and can be made once a year using the contact information detailed in the “Exercising Your California Privacy Rights” section of this California Residents Privacy Addendum.
Online Eraser Law.
If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with us, you have the right to request removal of unwanted information that you publicly post on the applicable website or mobile application. To request removal of such information, please contact us using the contact information detailed in the “Exercising Your California Privacy Rights” section of this California Residents Privacy Addendum, with details on where the information is posted. Upon receiving such a request, we will make reasonable good faith efforts to ensure that the information is not publicly available on the applicable website or mobile application, but the information will not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems and databases.
Additional Information
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites. Because there is no standard interpretation or practice for Do Not Track signals, like many websites, our website does not support Do Not Track requests at this time.
However, to opt-out of cookie and web beacon tracking, please see the “Withdrawing Your Consent for (Opting-Out of) Cookie Tracking” section of the Privacy Notice, or to opt-out of website-based third-party interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please see the “Opting Out of Third-Party Tailored Advertising” section of the Privacy Notice.
EXERCISING YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
To make any of the requests or exercise any of your California privacy rights described above, please contact us using one of following methods. Please note that you can only make a verifiable request for access twice within a 12-month period.
You may access certain personal information by signing into your account for the relevant brand. From there, you can update, correct, or modify that personal information (other than your order history)—you will need to update, correct, or modify your personal information in each of your accounts with our brands as changes in one brand account will not automatically update your other brand accounts. Please note that deleting any personal information in your account will not completely delete that information from our systems—to request that we delete your personal information from our systems, you must follow the directions below.
If you wish to access any personal information that is not contained in your relevant brand account profile, if you do not have an account and wish to access your personal information, if you wish to otherwise request information from us about the information we collected about you over the past 12 months, or if you wish to submit a deletion request, please contact us as detailed in the "Contact Us"
section of this California Residents Privacy Addendum.
Please note that if you are a member of one of our loyalty programs and you request that your personal information is deleted, you will be removed from that particular brand loyalty program.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS OUT OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
IMPORTANT: Your personal information will be sent to the United States and possibly other countries.
Our websites are hosted in the United States. If you are visiting one of our websites from outside the United States, your personal information will be transferred to, stored in, or processed in, the United States and transferred to, stored in, or processed in additional countries where our third-party service providers maintain facilities or operations.

Standard Contractual Clauses: We rely on the European Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries (i.e. the standard contractual clauses), and equivalent contracts issued by the relevant competent authority of the United Kingdom, when transferring personal information to our third-party service providers who are located in countries that the European Commission and the relevant competent authority of the United Kingdom as applicable have not found to have adequate levels of protection for personal information.

To determine the retention period of your personal information, we consider several criteria to make sure that we do not keep your personal information for longer than is necessary or appropriate. These criteria include:
the purpose for which we hold your personal information;
our legal and regulatory obligations in relation to that personal information, for example any financial reporting obligations or statutory retention obligations (for example, under commercial or tax law which usually last from seven years);
whether our relationship with you is ongoing;
any specific requests from you in relation to the deletion of your personal information; and
our legitimate business interests in relation to managing our own rights, for example the assertion or defense of any claims within the statutes of limitation.
When we no longer need to retain your personal information, it will be deleted or be anonymized so that you can no longer be identified from it.
