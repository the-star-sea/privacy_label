MANDATORY INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS: If you and any Arbitrating Entity (defined below) have a Dispute (defined below), the parties to the Dispute agree that they will make a good faith effort to resolve it informally. This process should lead to a resolution. In connection with any Dispute, a notice (“Notice”) must be sent to the other party that describes the Dispute. The Notice must include the claimant’s name, address, telephone number, email address, sufficient information to identify any transaction at issue; and a detailed description of (1) the Dispute, (2) the nature and basis of the claims, and (3) the nature and basis of the relief sought. The Notice must also verify that the information provided is true and accurate. You may send the Notice by email to: legalnotices@roomstogo.com or by mail to: Legal Department, 11540 Highway 92 East, Seffner, FL 33584. The claimant must personally sign the Notice. If an Arbitrating Entity has a Dispute with you, it will send the Notice to the address on file. After a Notice is received, you and the Arbitrating Entity agree to negotiate in good faith, including through an informal and individualized telephone conference between you and the Arbitrating Entity. If requested by the Arbitrating Entity, you must personally appear at and participate in the telephone conference (if you are represented by counsel, your counsel may also participate). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you and the Arbitrating Entity agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any formal dispute resolution proceeding, including a demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. If the sufficiency of a Notice or compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is at issue, it shall be decided by a court prior to the filing of any demand for arbitration.2. MANDATORY ARBITRATION: AFTER EXHAUSTION OF THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS, YOU AND ANY “ARBITRATING ENTITY” (WHICH INCLUDES RTG, ANY THIRD PARTY DELIVERY SERVICE PROVIDER THAT DELIVERS, SERVICES, OR ATTEMPTS TO DELIVER OR SERVICE YOUR MERCHANDISE, AND ANY OF ITS OR THEIR AFFILIATES, AND ALL OF ITS OR THEIR PARENT COMPANIES, SUBSIDIARIES, DIVISIONS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, PARTNERS, TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS) AGREE THAT ANY UNRESOLVED DISPUTE OR CLAIM BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM THAT RELATES IN ANY WAY TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE SOLD, PERFORMED, OR DISTRIBUTED BY ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, ANY TRANSACTION WITH ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, ANY WARRANTY MADE BY ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE, TO THE FINANCING OF ANY PURCHASE FROM ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, THE DELIVERY, ATTEMPTED DELIVERY, OR INSTALLATION OF YOUR MERCHANDISE, TO THE USE, COLLECTION OR STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, OR THE TERMS OF USE OR THE PRIVACY NOTICE, INCLUDING DISPUTES OR CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL OR STATE STATUTES, COMMON LAW, OR TORT LAW, WHETHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE (“DISPUTE”), MUST BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A COURT OR JURY. THE TERM “DISPUTE” AND THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL BE BROADLY INTERPRETED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU OR ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY MAY ELECT TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF THE DISPUTE QUALIFIES FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND THE MATTER PROCEEDS ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NOT A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS AND SEEKS INDIVIDUAL RELIEF SO LONG AS THE ACTION REMAINS IN THAT COURT AND IS NOT REMOVED OR APPEALED TO A COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION. THIS ELECTION MAY BE MADE AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ARBITRATOR. YOU AND ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY AGREE THAT WE EACH MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION/ARBITRATION AGREEMENT APPLIES TO DISPUTES ARISING BEFORE, ON, OR AFTER THE DATE OF YOUR PURCHASE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY WARRANTY IS IN EFFECT, AND IT SURVIVES CANCELLATION OF YOUR ORDER OR OTHER TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TERMINATION OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY.You and any Arbitrating Entity waive the right to a trial by jury and any right to have a Dispute heard in court to the fullest extent permitted by law. In arbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts. The arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court, in favor of or against only the parties to the arbitration, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Under no circumstances may the arbitrator preside over any class or collective action. The arbitrator must follow the terms of the Agreements as a court would. The arbitrator may not consider any prior settlement offers in making the decision. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall be binding only among the parties to the arbitration and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. A single arbitrator with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will conduct the arbitration, and the amount and nature of the award may not exceed the relief allowed by applicable law. The arbitration will be conducted in the county of your residence or another mutually agreed location. The AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. If AAA will not apply those rules, then AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. The AAA’s rules and a form that can be used to initiate arbitration proceedings are available at www.adr.org. You and Arbitrating Entity agree that if for any reason AAA will not conduct or becomes unavailable to conduct the arbitration consistent with this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, then the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding consistent with the terms of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. The parties further agree that the choice of AAA as a forum is not integral to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.3. DELEGATION/ARBITRABILITY: The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement exclusively and governs its interpretation and enforcement. Except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the authority to decide, and shall decide, all issues or disputes relating to the meaning, validity, formation, enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (including “gateway” issues of arbitrability), the Terms and Conditions of Sale, the Limited Warranty, the Terms of Use, and the Privacy Notice, except that a court will resolve any question regarding the meaning, validity, or enforceability of Section 4 of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.4. ARBITRATION CLASS ACTION WAIVER: You and any Arbitrating Entity agree that the arbitration will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not on a class, representative, consolidated, collective, or private attorney general basis. A Dispute may not be consolidated with a claim brought or discovery conducted by any person or entity that is not a party to the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a party to the arbitration proceeding and may only award such relief as is necessary to provide relief to a party to the arbitration proceeding. This waiver of class actions and collective relief is an essential part of this binding Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement and cannot be severed from it. If a court determines that the class action and collective relief waiver is not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief shall proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.5. FEES, COSTS, AND PROCEDURES RELATING TO ARBITRATION: Except as otherwise provided herein, all filing fees, administrative fees, and arbitrator fees and expenses will be paid in accordance with the applicable AAA rules. If your total damage claims are $25,000 or less, not including your attorneys’ fees: (1) the arbitrator may award you your reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and costs (collectively up to $10,000) if you prevail in the arbitration and if your award on your claim (excluding costs and fees) exceeds by 50% the last offer from the Arbitrating Entity, which offer shall not be shared with arbitrator until after the award; and (2) the arbitrator may not award any Arbitrating Entity its attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and/or costs , including AAA fees, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith or after application of the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator. If your total damage claims are more than $25,000, not including your attorneys’ fees, then the arbitrator may award the prevailing party all or a portion of its reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and/or costs, including AAA fees, to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court or if the arbitrator determines that a claim or defense was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith or after application of the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator. In arbitrations conducted under AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the Dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only/desk arbitration, except that any party may ask for a hearing or the arbitrator may decide that a hearing is necessary. If requested by the Arbitrating Entity, you shall individually and personally appear (with your counsel if you have one) at an individualized telephone conference with a case manager before an arbitrator is appointed. If You or any Arbitrating Entity files or causes to be filed in any court, agency, or other non-arbitral tribunal a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (an “Arbitrable Suit”), the defendant/respondent may provide written notice to the plaintiff/claimant (or its attorney) of its duty to arbitrate the Arbitrable Suit or comply with the informal dispute resolution process under this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. If the plaintiff/claimant does not dismiss the Arbitrable Suit within 14 calendar days of such notice, and the defendant/respondent successfully moves to compel compliance with the terms of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, the plaintiff/claimant shall be responsible for paying the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred by the defendant/respondent in responding to and moving to compel arbitration of the Arbitrable Suit. Any request for such fees and costs shall be addressed to and decided by an arbitrator as if it were a Dispute and otherwise in accordance with this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.6. MASS CLAIMS: If twenty-five or more similar claims are asserted against one or more Arbitrating Entities by the same counsel or are otherwise coordinated (collectively, “Mass Claims”), you understand and agree that the resolution of your claim might be delayed. You also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process and that your claim, and all Mass Claims, shall be subject to the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule at the time the claims are selected for bellwether proceedings. Counsel for the claimants and counsel for the Arbitrating Entities shall each select ten cases to proceed first in arbitration in individual bellwether proceedings. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration until they are selected for a bellwether proceeding. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial bellwether proceedings, each side shall select another ten cases to proceed to arbitration for a second set of bellwether proceedings. This process shall continue until the parties are able to resolve all of the claims, either through settlement or arbitration. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of this process. The statute of limitations shall be tolled for an individual’s claims until the time the individual’s case is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against the Arbitrating Entities.7. NON-ARBITRATION CLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER: You and any Arbitrating Entity agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that if for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration: (1) you and any Arbitrating Entity waive any right to a jury trial; (2) the Dispute will proceed solely on an individual, non-class, non- representative basis; and (3) neither you nor any Arbitrating Entity may be a class representative or class member or otherwise participate in any class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general proceeding.8. SEVERABILITY: Except as specifically provided herein, if any part of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, then it shall be stricken and the other parts of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.9. CHANGES: If we make any future changes to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), they shall not apply to any Dispute for which you have previously provided Notice to any Arbitrating Entity.vTOSO221201

PROCESO INFORMAL OBLIGATORIO PARA LA RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS: Si usted o cualquier Entidad Arbitrante (como se define más adelante) tienen una Disputa (como se define más adelante), las partes de la Disputa aceptan que harán un esfuerzo de buena fe para resolverla de manera informal. Este proceso debería llevar a una resolución. En conexión con cualquier Disputa, se debe enviar una notificación ("Notificación") a la otra parte en la que se describa la Disputa. La Notificación debe incluir el nombre, la dirección, el número telefónico, la dirección de correo electrónico del reclamante, así como suficiente información para identificar las transacciones que representan un problema. Todo esto además de una descripción detallada de (1) la Disputa, (2) la naturaleza y la base de las reclamaciones y (3) la naturaleza y base de la compensación que se busca. La Notificación debe verificar también que la información provista sea cierta y precisa. Usted puede enviar la Notificación por correo electrónico a: legalnotices@roomstogo.com o por correo postal a la dirección: Legal Department, 11540 Highway 92 East, Seffner, FL 33584. El reclamante debe firmar personalmente la Notificación. Si una Entidad Arbitrante tiene una Disputa con usted, esta le enviará la Notificación a la dirección que aparece en su archivo. Luego de recibida la Notificación, usted y la Entidad Arbitrante aceptan negociar de buena fe, incluso a través de una conferencia telefónica informal e individualizada entre usted y la Entidad Arbitrante. Si así lo solicita la Entidad Arbitrante, usted debe presentarse personalmente y participar en la conferencia telefónica (si usted cuenta con la representación de un abogado, su abogado también puede participar). Si la Disputa no se resuelve dentro de los sesenta (60) días posteriores a la recepción de la Notificación (período que puede extenderse si las partes así lo acuerdan), usted y la Entidad Arbitrante aceptan las disposiciones de resolución de disputas que se establecen más adelante. El cumplimiento y la realización de este proceso informal para la resolución de disputas es una condición previa para iniciar un proceso formal para la resolución de disputas, incluida una solicitud de arbitraje. La prescripción y cualquier plazo de cargos de presentación permanecerán suspendidos mientras las partes participan en este proceso informal para la resolución de disputas. Si la suficiencia de una Notificación o el cumplimiento de este proceso informal para la resolución de disputas son objeto de controversia, un tribunal deberá emitir una decisión al respecto antes de la presentación de una solicitud de arbitraje.2. ARBITRAJE OBLIGATORIO: LUEGO DE AGOTAR EL PROCESO INFORMAL PARA LA RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS, USTED Y CUALQUIER "ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE" (QUE INCLUYE A RTG, CUALQUIER TERCERO QUE ENTREGUE, REPARE O INTENTE ENTREGAR O REPARAR LA MERCANCÍA DE USTED, Y CUALQUIERA DE SUS FILIALES, EMPRESAS MATRICES, SUBSIDIARIAS, DIVISIONES, ACCIONISTAS, MIEMBROS, GERENTES, SOCIOS, FIDEICOMISARIOS, DIRECTORES, EJECUTIVOS, EMPLEADOS, REPRESENTANTES, PREDECESORES, SUCESORES O CESIONARIOS) ACUERDAN QUE CUALQUIER DISPUTA O RECLAMACIÓN NO RESUELTA ENTRE USTED Y CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTRAS, CUALQUIER DISPUTA O RECLAMACIÓN QUE SE RELACIONE DE CUALQUIER FORMA CON SU RELACIÓN CON CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTROS, CUALQUIER PRODUCTO O SERVICIO VENDIDO, REALIZADO O DISTRIBUIDO POR CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, CUALQUIER TRANSACCIÓN CON CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, CUALQUIER GARANTÍA EMITIDA POR CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, LOS TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES DE VENTA, EL FINANCIAMIENTO DE CUALQUIER COMPRA A CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, LA ENTREGA, INTENTO DE ENTREGA O INSTALACIÓN DE SU MERCANCÍA, EL USO, RECOLECCIÓN O ALMACENAMIENTO DE INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL, O LOS TÉRMINOS DE USO O EL AVISO DE PRIVACIDAD, INCLUYENDO DISPUTAS O RECLAMACIONES BAJO LAS LEYES FEDERALES O ESTATALES, EL DERECHO CONSUETUDINARIO Y LAS LEYES DE RESPONSABILIDAD EXTRACONTRACTUAL ("DISPUTA"), DEBE RESOLVERSE EXCLUSIVAMENTE MEDIANTE UN ARBITRAJE DEFINITIVO Y VINCULANTE Y NO MEDIANTE TRIBUNALES O JURADOS. EL TÉRMINO “DISPUTA” Y EL REQUISITO DE ARBITRAR SE INTERPRETARÁN DE MANERA AMPLIA. INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE LO ANTERIOR, USTED O CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE PUEDEN OPTAR POR RESOLVER UNA DISPUTA EN UN TRIBUNAL DE RECLAMOS MENORES SI LA DISPUTA CALIFICA PARA TAL TRIBUNAL Y EL ASUNTO PROCEDE ÚNICAMENTE COMO CASO INDIVIDUAL (NO COLECTIVO NI REPRESENTATIVO) Y BUSCA COMPENSACIÓN INDIVIDUAL, SIEMPRE Y CUANDO LA ACCIÓN PERMANEZCA EN ESE TRIBUNAL Y NO SEA REMOVIDA NI APELADA EN UN TRIBUNAL DE JURISDICCIÓN GENERAL. ESTA ELECCIÓN PUEDE HACERSE EN CUALQUIER MOMENTO ANTES DE LA ASIGNACIÓN DE UN ÁRBITRO. USTED Y CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE ACEPTAN QUE AMBAS PARTES PODEMOS PRESENTAR UNA DEMANDA ANTE UN TRIBUNAL PARA QUE EMITA UNA MEDIDA CAUTELAR PARA EVITAR VIOLACIONES A LOS DERECHOS DE LA PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL U OTROS ABUSOS DE LOS MISMOS. ESTE ACUERDO DE ARBITRAJE Y RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS APLICA A LAS DISPUTAS QUE SURJAN ANTES, DURANTE O DESPUÉS DE LA FECHA DE SU COMPRA, INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE CUALQUIER GARANTÍA QUE ESTÉ VIGENTE, Y SOBREVIVE A LA CANCELACIÓN DE SU PEDIDO U OTRA RECISIÓN DE LOS ACUERDOS, INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTRAS, LA RECISIÓN DE LA GARANTÍA LIMITADA.Usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante renuncian al derecho a un juicio con jurado y a cualquier derecho a una audiencia de la Disputa en un tribunal, en la medida más amplia permitida por la ley. En el arbitraje, las disputas son resueltas por un árbitro neutro en lugar de un juez o jurado, la revelación de documentos fundamentales es más limitada que en un tribunal y la decisión del árbitro está sujeta a revisión limitada por los tribunales. El árbitro puede, en base individual, laudar los mismos daños y perjuicios e indemnizaciones que un tribunal en favor o en contra únicamente de las partes del arbitraje, incluyendo compensaciones monetarias por daños y perjuicios, medidas cautelares y de reparación declaratoria, y solo en la medida necesaria para proporcionar la indemnización justificada por la reclamación individual de la parte en cuestión. En ninguna circunstancia el árbitro podrá tomar decisiones sobre acciones colectivas. El árbitro debe regirse por los términos de los Acuerdos, tal y como lo haría un tribunal. El árbitro no puede considerar ninguna oferta de acuerdo previo al tomar su decisión. Independientemente de la forma en que se lleve a cabo el arbitraje, el árbitro emitirá una decisión por escrito y en la misma expondrá los resultados y las conclusiones esenciales en los que se basa el laudo. El laudo del arbitraje será vinculante únicamente entre las partes de este y no tendrá un efecto excluyente sobre ningún otro arbitraje o procedimiento que involucre a una parte distinta, siempre y cuando el árbitro pueda considerar fallos en otros arbitrajes que involucren a individuos distintos. La sentencia sobre el laudo del árbitro podrá registrarse en cualquier tribunal de jurisdicción competente. El arbitraje será conducido por un único árbitro de la American Arbitration Association (Asociación Americana de Arbitraje, "AAA") y el monto y la naturaleza del laudo no debe exceder la compensación establecida por las leyes aplicables. El arbitraje será conducido en el condado donde usted resida o en cualquier otra ubicación mutuamente acordada. Se aplicará el Reglamento de Arbitraje de Consumo de la AAA, según las modificaciones al mismo establecidas por este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. Si la AAA no aplica dicho reglamento, se aplicará el Reglamento de Arbitraje Comercial de la AAA, según las modificaciones al mismo establecidas por este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. El reglamento de la AAA y un formulario que puede utilizarse para iniciar los procedimientos de arbitraje están disponibles en www.adr.org. Usted y la Entidad Arbitrante acuerdan que, si por cualquier razón la AAA no lleva a cabo o no está disponible para llevar a cabo el arbitraje de conformidad con este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas, las partes acordarán una organización de arbitraje suplente. Si las partes no logran llegar a un acuerdo en este sentido, las partes deberán pedir a un tribunal de jurisdicción competente que les asigne una organización de arbitraje para que administre un procedimiento de conformidad con los términos del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. Las partes acuerdan además que la elección de la AAA como foro no es parte integral del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas.3. DELEGACIÓN/ARBITRABILIDAD: La Ley Federal de Arbitraje (“FAA”) se aplica sobre este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas exclusivamente y rige su interpretación y cumplimiento. Excepto si se especifica lo contrario en otra parte de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas, el árbitro, y no ningún tribunal o agencia local, estatal o federal, tendrá la facultad de decidir y decidirá sobre todos los asuntos o disputas relacionados con el significado, la validez, formación, exigibilidad, interpretación, alcance y aplicación de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas (incluida la cuestión de la posibilidad de someter a arbitraje), los Términos y Condiciones de Venta y la Garantía Limitada, los Términos de uso y el Aviso de Privacidad, salvo que un tribunal dirimirá cualquier cuestión relacionada con el significado, la validez y el cumplimiento de la Sección 4 del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas.4. RENUNCIA A DEMANDA COLECTIVA DE ARBITRAJE: Usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante acuerdan que el arbitraje se llevará a cabo únicamente en base individual y no en una base general colectiva, representativa, consolidada ni de abogado privado. Una Disputa no puede ser consolidada con una reclamación o revelación de documentos fundamentales realizada por una persona o entidad cualquiera que no forme parte del procedimiento de arbitraje. El árbitro no puede laudar compensación a ninguna persona o entidad que no sea una de las partes del procedimiento de arbitraje, y solo puede laudar dicha compensación según corresponda para proporcionar compensación a una de las partes del procedimiento de arbitraje. La renuncia a demandas colectivas y compensación colectiva es una parte fundamental de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas vinculante y no puede separarse del mismo. Si un tribunal determina que la renuncia a demandas colectivas y compensación colectiva no puede aplicarse a una reclamación o una solicitud de compensación en particular y todas las apelaciones a dicha decisión se han agotado (o la decisión es de otra forma definitiva), las partes acuerdan que esa reclamación o solicitud de compensación en particular se procese en tribunales pero que la misma deberá separarse y permanecer a la espera del arbitraje del resto de las reclamaciones.5. HONORARIOS, COSTAS Y PROCEDIMIENTOS RELACIONADOS CON EL ARBITRAJE: A menos que se disponga lo contrario en el presente, todos los cargos de presentación, cargos administrativos y cargos y gastos del árbitro serán pagados de acuerdo con el reglamento aplicable de la AAA. Si el total de sus reclamaciones por daños y perjuicios es de $25,000 o menos, sin incluir los honorarios de sus abogados: (1) el árbitro puede laudarle a usted los honorarios razonables de abogados, honorarios de expertos y costas (en conjunto por hasta $10,000) si usted gana el arbitraje y si el laudo por su reclamación (excluyendo costas y honorarios) excede por 50 % la última oferta de la Entidad Arbitrante, oferta que no debe compartirse con el árbitro hasta luego del laudo; y (2) el árbitro podría no laudar a ninguna Entidad Arbitrante sus honorarios de abogados, honorarios de expertos o costas a si determina que su reclamación fue frívola, se presentó por un fin inadecuado o de mala fe o después de la aplicación de las disposiciones del Reglamento Federal del Procedimiento Civil 68, el cual se aplicará y deberá ser hecho valer por el árbitro. Si el total de las reclamaciones por daños y perjuicios de usted es más de $25,000, sin incluir los honorarios de sus abogados, el árbitro puede laudar a la parte vencedora la totalidad o parte de sus gastos razonables por concepto de honorarios de abogados, honorarios de expertos y costas, incluidos los cargos de la AAA, en la medida en que dichos cargos y costas si un tribunal pudiera laudarlos o si el árbitro determina que la reclamación o la defensa fue frívola o se presentó por un fin inadecuado o de mala fe o después de la aplicación de las disposiciones del Reglamento Federal del Procedimiento Civil 68, el cual se aplicará y deberá ser hecho valer por el árbitro. En arbitrajes llevados a cabo de conformidad con el Reglamento de Arbitraje de Consumo de la AAA, cuando no haya reclamaciones o contrarreclamaciones divulgadas que excedan los $25,000, la Disputa se solucionará mediante el envío de documentos únicamente/arbitraje de escritorio, excepto cuando cualquiera de las partes solicite una audiencia o el árbitro decida que es necesaria una audiencia. Si así lo solicita la Entidad Arbitrante, usted debe presentarse personal e individualmente (con su abogado si tiene uno) en una conferencia telefónica individualizada con un gerente de casos antes de que se asigne un árbitro. Si usted o cualquier Entidad Arbitrante presentan o causan que se presente ante un tribunal, agencia u otro tribunal arbitral cualquiera una Disputa que esté sujeta a arbitraje conforme a este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas (una "Demanda Arbitrable"), el demandado puede proporcionar una notificación por escrito al demandante (o su abogado) de su deber de someter a arbitraje la Demanda Arbitrable o cumplir el proceso informal de resolución de disputas establecido en este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. Si el demandante no desestima la Demanda Arbitrable en un plazo de 14 días calendarios a partir de dicha notificación y el demandado tiene éxito con un recurso para forzar el cumplimiento de los términos de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas, el demandante será responsable de pagar los honorarios profesionales razonables de los abogados y otras costas en los que el demandado incurra al responder a la demanda y forzar el arbitraje de la Demanda Arbitrable. Cualquier solicitud por dichos honorarios y costas se dirigirá al árbitro y será este quien decida al respecto como si se tratase de una Disputa y de conformidad con este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas.6. RECLAMACIONES MASIVAS: Si un mismo abogado presenta veinticinco o más reclamaciones similares en contra de una o más Entidades Arbitrantes o si estas se coordinan (en colectivo, "Reclamaciones masivas"), usted entiende y acepta que la resolución de su reclamación podría retrasarse. Usted acepta también el siguiente proceso coordinado de casos de muestra (bellwether) y que su reclamación, así como todas las Reclamaciones masivas, estarán sujetas a la tabla de tarifas de Presentación de Múltiples Casos de Consumo de la AAA vigente al momento en el que se seleccionan las reclamaciones para los procedimientos de casos de muestra. El abogado de los demandantes y el abogado de las Entidades Arbitrantes deben seleccionar cada uno diez casos para procesarlos primero en el arbitraje en procedimientos de casos de muestra individuales. El resto de los casos no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados en el arbitraje hasta tanto sean seleccionados para un procedimiento de casos de muestra. Si las partes no logran resolver los casos restantes luego de la conclusión de los procedimientos de casos de muestra iniciales, cada parte deberá seleccionar otros diez casos para proceder al arbitraje para un segundo conjunto de procedimientos de casos de muestra. Este proceso continuará así hasta que las partes logren resolver todas las reclamaciones, bien sea a través de acuerdos mutuos o el arbitraje. Solo se puede asignar un caso a cada árbitro como parte de este proceso. Se suspenderá la prescripción para las reclamaciones de un individuo hasta que el caso de dicho individuo se seleccione para un procedimiento de casos de muestra, se retire o se resuelva por otros medios. Un tribunal tendrá autoridad para obligar a que se cumpla lo estipulado en este párrafo y, de ser necesario, emitir una medida cautelar para evitar la presentación masiva de solicitudes de arbitraje en contra de las Entidades Arbitrantes.7. RENUNCIA A DEMANDA COLECTIVA SIN ARBITRAJE Y A JUICIO CON JURADO: Usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante aceptan que, en la mayor medida permitida por la ley, si por cualquier motivo procede una Disputa en tribunales en lugar del arbitraje: (1) usted y cualquier Entidad arbitrante renuncian al derecho a un juicio con jurado; (2) la Disputa procederá únicamente sobre una base individual, no colectiva ni representativa; y (3) ni usted ni ninguna Entidad arbitrante pueden ser miembros de una demanda colectiva o representativa, ni de otra forma participar en ningún procedimiento general colectivo, representativo, consolidado o de abogado privado.8. DIVISIBILIDAD: Excepto por lo específicamente previsto en el presente documento, si alguna parte del Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas se considera inválida o imposible de hacer cumplir, dicha parte se eliminará y el resto del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas permanecerá en total vigor y efecto.9. CAMBIOS: Si en el futuro realizamos cambios a este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas (distinto a un cambio en la Dirección de Notificación), dichos cambios no aplicarán a ninguna Disputa para la cual usted ya haya entregado Notificación a cualquier Entidad Arbitrante.vTOSO221205SPA

Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process.
If you and any Arbitrating Entity (defined below) have a Dispute (defined below), the parties to the Dispute agree that they will make a good faith effort to resolve it informally. This process should lead to a resolution. In connection with any Dispute, a ("Notice") must be sent to the other party that describes the Dispute. The Notice must include the claimant’s name, address, telephone number, email address, sufficient information to identify any transaction at issue; and a detailed description of (1) the Dispute, (2) the nature and basis of the claims, and (3) the nature and basis of the relief sought. The Notice must also verify that the information provided is true and accurate. The claimant must personally sign the Notice. You may send the Notice by email to: legalnotices@roomstogo.com or by mail to: Legal Department, 11540 Highway 92 East, Seffner, FL 33584. If an Arbitrating Entity has a Dispute with you, it will send the Notice to the address on file. After a Notice is received, you and the Arbitrating Entity agree to negotiate in good faith, including through an informal and individualized telephone conference between you and the Arbitrating Entity. If requested by the Arbitrating Entity, you must personally appear at and participate in the telephone conference (if you are represented by counsel, your counsel may also participate). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you and the Arbitrating Entity agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any formal dispute resolution proceeding, including a demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. If the sufficiency of a Notice or compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is at issue, it shall be decided by a court prior to the filing of any demand for arbitration.2. Mandatory Arbitration: AFTER EXHAUSTION OF THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS, YOU AND ANY "ARBITRATING ENTITY" (WHICH INCLUDES RTG, ANY THIRD PARTY THAT DELIVERS, SERVICES OR ATTEMPTS TO DELIVER OR SERVICE YOUR MERCHANDISE, AND ANY OF ITS OR THEIR AFFILIATES, AND ALL OF ITS OR THEIR PARENT COMPANIES, SUBSIDIARIES, DIVISIONS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, PARTNERS, TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS), AGREE THAT ANY UNRESOLVED DISPUTE OR CLAIM BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM THAT RELATES IN ANY WAY TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE SOLD, PERFORMED OR DISTRIBUTED BY ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, ANY TRANSACTION WITH ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, ANY WARRANTY MADE BY ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE, TO THE FINANCING OF ANY PURCHASE FROM ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, THE DELIVERY, ATTEMPTED DELIVERY, OR INSTALLATION OF YOUR MERCHANDISE, TO THE USE, COLLECTION OR STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, OR THE TERMS OF USE OR THE PRIVACY NOTICE, INCLUDING DISPUTES OR CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL OR STATE STATUTES, COMMON LAW OR TORT LAW, WHETHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE ("DISPUTE"), MUST BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A COURT OR JURY. THE TERM "DISPUTE" AND THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL BE BROADLY INTERPRETED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU OR ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY MAY ELECT TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF THE DISPUTE QUALIFIES FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND THE MATTER PROCEEDS ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NOT A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS AND SEEKS INDIVIDUAL RELIEF SO LONG AS THE ACTION REMAINS IN THAT COURT AND IS NOT REMOVED OR APPEALED TO A COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION. THIS ELECTION MAY BE MADE AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ARBITRATOR. YOU AND ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY AGREE THAT WE EACH MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION/ARBITRATION AGREEMENT APPLIES TO DISPUTES ARISING BEFORE, ON, OR AFTER THE DATE OF YOUR PURCHASE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY WARRANTY IS IN EFFECT, AND IT SURVIVES CANCELLATION OF YOUR ORDER OR OTHER TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TERMINATION OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY.You and any Arbitrating Entity waive the right to a trial by jury and any right to have a Dispute heard in court to the fullest extent permitted by law. In arbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the arbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts. The arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court in favor of or against only the parties to the arbitration, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Under no circumstances may the arbitrator preside over any class or collective action. The arbitrator must follow the terms of the Agreements as a court would. The arbitrator may not consider any prior settlement offers in making the decision. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall be binding only among the parties to the arbitration and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. A single arbitrator with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will conduct the arbitration, and the amount and nature of the award may not exceed the relief allowed by applicable law. The arbitration will be conducted in the county of your residence or another mutually agreed location. The AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. If AAA will not apply those rules, then AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. The AAA's rules and a form that can be used to initiate arbitration proceedings are available at www.adr.org. You and Arbitrating Entity agree that if for any reason AAA will not conduct or becomes unavailable to conduct the arbitration consistent with this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, then the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding consistent with the terms of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. The parties further agree that the choice of AAA as a forum is not integral to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.3. Delegation/Arbitrability. The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") applies to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement exclusively and governs its interpretation and enforcement. Except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the authority to decide, and shall decide, all issues or disputes relating to the meaning, validity, formation, enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (including "gateway" issues of arbitrability), the Terms and Conditions of Sale, the Terms of Use, and the Privacy Notice, except that a court will resolve any question regarding the meaning, validity, or enforceability of Section 4 of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.4. Arbitration Class Action Waiver: You and any Arbitrating Entity agree that the arbitration will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not on a class, representative, consolidated, collective, or private attorney general basis. A Dispute may not be consolidated with a claim brought or discovery conducted by any person or entity that is not a party to the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a party to the arbitration proceeding and may only award such relief as is necessary to provide relief to a party to the arbitration proceeding. This waiver of class actions and collective relief is an essential part of this binding Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement and cannot be severed from it. If a court determines that the class action and collective relief waiver is not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief shall proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.5. Fees, Costs, and Procedures Relating to Arbitration:
Except as otherwise provided herein, all filing fees, administrative fees, and arbitrator fees and expenses will be paid in accordance with the applicable AAA rules. If your total damage claims are $25,000 or less, not including your attorneys' fees: (1) the arbitrator may award you your reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, and costs (collectively up to $10,000) if you prevail in the arbitration and if your award on your claim (excluding costs and fees) exceeds by 50% the last offer from the Arbitrating Entity, which offer shall not be shared with arbitrator until after the award; and (2) the arbitrator may not award any Arbitrating Entity its attorneys' fees, expert fees, and/or costs, including AAA fees, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith or after application of the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator. If your total damage claims are more than $25,000, not including your attorneys' fees, then the arbitrator may award the prevailing party all or a portion of its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, and/or costs, including AAA fees, to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court or if the arbitrator determines that a claim or defense was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith or after application of the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator. In arbitrations conducted under AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules, where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the Dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only/desk arbitration, except that any party may ask for a hearing or the arbitrator may decide that a hearing is necessary. If requested by the Arbitrating Entity, you shall individually and personally appear (with your counsel if you have one) at an individualized telephone conference with a case manager before an arbitrator is appointed.If You or any Arbitrating Entity files or causes to be filed in any court, agency, or other non- arbitral tribunal a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (an "Arbitrable Suit"), the defendant/respondent may provide written notice to the plaintiff/claimant (or its attorney) of its duty to arbitrate the Arbitrable Suit or comply with the informal dispute resolution process under this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. If the plaintiff/claimant does not dismiss the Arbitrable Suit within 14 calendar days of such notice, and the defendant/respondent successfully moves to compel compliance with the terms of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, the plaintiff/claimant shall be responsible for paying the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred by the defendant/respondent in responding to and moving to compel arbitration of the Arbitrable Suit. Any request for such fees and costs shall be addressed to and decided by an arbitrator as if it were a Dispute and otherwise in accordance with this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.6. Mass Claims: If twenty-five or more similar claims are asserted against one or more Arbitrating Entities by the same counsel or are otherwise coordinated (collectively, "Mass Claims"), you understand and agree that the resolution of your claim might be delayed. You also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process and that your claim, and all Mass Claims, shall be subject to the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule at the time the claims are selected for bellwether proceedings. Counsel for the claimants and counsel for the Arbitrating Entities shall each select ten cases to proceed first in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration until they are selected for a bellwether proceeding. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial bellwether proceeding, each side shall select another ten cases to proceed to arbitration for a second bellwether proceeding. This process shall continue until the parties are able to resolve all of the claims, either through settlement or arbitration. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of this process. The statute of limitations shall be tolled for an individual’s claims until the time the individual’s case is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against the Arbitrating Entities.7. Non-Arbitration Class Action and Jury Waiver: You and any Arbitrating Entity agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that if for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration: (1) you and any Arbitrating Entity waive any right to a jury trial; (2) the Dispute will proceed solely on an individual, non-class, non-representative basis; and (3) neither you nor any Arbitrating Entity may be a class representative or class member or otherwise participate in any class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general proceeding.8. Severability. Except as specifically provided herein, if any part of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, then it shall be stricken and the other parts of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.9. Changes: If we make any future changes to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), they shall not apply to any Dispute for which you have previously provided Notice to any Arbitrating Entity.vTOSO220603

Limitación de daños para los servicios de entrega: Si usted compra servicios de entrega de o a través de RTG, RTG usará un proveedor tercero de servicios de entrega ("el proveedor de servicios de entrega"). El proveedor de servicios de entrega es el beneficiario tercero expresamente previsto de esta Limitación de Daños. LA RESPONSABILIDAD TOTAL DE RTG Y DE CUALQUIER PROVEEDOR TERCERO DE SERVICIOS DE ENTREGA QUE ENTREGUE O INTENTE ENTREGAR SU MERCANCÍA Y DE SUS FILIALES, COMPAÑÍAS MATRICES, SUBSIDIARIAS, DIVISIONES, ACCIONISTAS, MIEMBROS, DIRECTORES, EJECUTIVOS, EMPLEADOS, REPRESENTANTES, PREDECESORES, SUCESORES Y CESIONARIOS, RELACIONADA DE ALGUNA MANERA CON LOS SERVICIOS DE ENTREGA, NO DEBERÁ EXCEDER DOS VECES EL MONTO TOTAL QUE USTED PAGÓ POR LA ENTREGA DE SU MERCANCÍA, YA SEA QUE USTED RECLAME DAÑOS Y PERJUICIOS (INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTROS, DAÑOS A BIENES INMUEBLES O PERSONALES) RELACIONADOS CON UN INCUMPLIMIENTO DE CONTRATO O AGRAVIO O CUALQUIER OTRA TEORÍA DE RESPONSABILIDAD. EN NINGÚN CASO RTG O CUALQUIER OTRO PROVEEDOR TERCERO DE SERVICIOS DE ENTREGA QUE ENTREGUE O INTENTE ENTREGAR SU MERCANCÍA Y SUS FILIALES, COMPAÑÍAS MATRICES, SUBSIDIARIAS, DIVISIONES, ACCIONISTAS, MIEMBROS, DIRECTORES, EJECUTIVOS, EMPLEADOS, REPRESENTANTES, PREDECESORES, SUCESORES Y CESIONARIOS SERÁN RESPONSABLES POR DAÑOS CONSECUENTES O INCIDENTALES RELACIONADOS CON SUS SERVICIOS DE ENTREGA. Esta limitación de responsabilidad no aplicará a (a) la responsabilidad que resulte de una negligencia grave o conducta dolosa de parte del proveedor de servicios de entrega o de RTG y (b) muerte o lesión corporal que resulte de actos negligentes u omisiones del proveedor de servicios de entrega o de RTG. Algunos estados no permiten la exclusión o limitación de daños y perjuicios incidentales o indirectos, de modo que la limitación que precede podría no aplicar para usted.8.
Usted acepta que podemos tomar o hacer que se tomen fotografías en el momento de la entrega, intento de entrega, instalación de la mercancía o durante citas de servicio y utilizarlas para ayudar a resolver problemas con la mercancía, la entrega, la instalación, daños o servicio de atención al cliente y para verificar la ubicación de la entrega o realizar auditorías para fines de control de calidad.ACUERDO DE ARBITRAJE Y RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS: LEA DETENIDAMENTE – ESTE ACUERDO AFECTA SUS DERECHOS LEGALESINDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE CUALQUIER LEY QUE INDIQUE LO CONTRARIO, USTED DEBE NOTIFICARNOS DE LA FORMA ESTABLECIDA EN ESTE ACUERDO DE ARBITRAJE Y RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS CUALQUIER RECLAMACIÓN DENTRO DEL PERÍODO DE UN AÑO A PARTIR DEL MOMENTO EN QUE SE PRODUCE, DE LO CONTRARIO, SU RECLAMACIÓN NO APLICARÁ Y QUEDARÁ VETADA POR EL TIEMPO TRANSCURRIDO EN LA MAYOR MEDIDA PERMITIDA POR LA LEY.1.
Proceso informal obligatorio para la resolución de disputas. Si usted o cualquier Entidad Arbitrante (como se define más adelante) tienen una Disputa (como se define más adelante), las partes de la Disputa aceptan que harán un esfuerzo de buena fe para resolverla de manera informal. Este proceso debería llevar a una resolución. En conexión con cualquier Disputa, se debe enviar una ("Notificación") a la otra parte en la que se describa la Disputa. La Notificación debe incluir el nombre, la dirección, el número telefónico, la dirección de correo electrónico del reclamante, así como suficiente información para identificar las transacciones que representan un problema. Todo esto además de una descripción detallada de (1) la Disputa, (2) la naturaleza y la base de las reclamaciones y (3) la naturaleza y base de la compensación que se busca. La Notificación debe verificar también que la información provista sea cierta y precisa. El reclamante debe firmar personalmente la Notificación. Usted puede enviar la Notificación por correo electrónico a: legalnotices@roomstogo.com o por correo postal a la dirección: Legal Department, 11540 Highway 92 East, Seffner, FL 33584. Si una Entidad Arbitrante tiene una Disputa con usted, esta le enviará la Notificación a la dirección que aparece en su archivo. Luego de recibida la Notificación, usted y la Entidad Arbitrante aceptan negociar de buena fe, incluso a través de una conferencia telefónica informal e individualizada entre usted y la Entidad Arbitrante. Si así lo solicita la Entidad Arbitrante, usted debe presentarse personalmente y participar en la conferencia telefónica (si usted cuenta con la representación de un abogado, su abogado también puede participar). Si la Disputa no se resuelve dentro de los sesenta (60) días posteriores a la recepción de la Notificación (período que puede extenderse si las partes así lo acuerdan), usted y la Entidad Arbitrante aceptan las disposiciones de resolución de disputas que se establecen más adelante. El cumplimiento y la realización de este proceso informal para la resolución de disputas es una condición previa para iniciar un proceso formal para la resolución de disputas, incluida una solicitud de arbitraje. La prescripción y cualquier plazo de cargos de presentación permanecerán suspendidos mientras las partes participan en este proceso informal para la resolución de disputas. Si la suficiencia de una Notificación o el cumplimiento de este proceso informal para la resolución de disputas son objeto de controversia, un tribunal deberá emitir una decisión al respecto antes de la presentación de una solicitud de arbitraje.2.
Arbitraje obligatorio: LUEGO DE AGOTAR EL PROCESO INFORMAL PARA LA RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS, USTED Y CUALQUIER "ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE" (QUE INCLUYE A RTG, CUALQUIER TERCERO QUE ENTREGUE, REPARE O INTENTE ENTREGAR O REPARAR LA MERCANCÍA DE USTED, Y CUALQUIERA DE SUS FILIALES, EMPRESAS MATRICES, SUBSIDIARIAS, DIVISIONES, ACCIONISTAS, MIEMBROS, GERENTES, SOCIOS, FIDEICOMISARIOS, DIRECTORES, EJECUTIVOS, EMPLEADOS, REPRESENTANTES, PREDECESORES, SUCESORES O CESIONARIOS) ACUERDAN QUE CUALQUIER DISPUTA O RECLAMACIÓN NO RESUELTA ENTRE USTED Y CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTRAS, CUALQUIER DISPUTA O RECLAMACIÓN QUE SE RELACIONE DE CUALQUIER FORMA CON SU RELACIÓN CON CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTROS, CUALQUIER PRODUCTO O SERVICIO VENDIDO, REALIZADO O DISTRIBUIDO POR CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, CUALQUIER TRANSACCIÓN CON CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, CUALQUIER GARANTÍA EMITIDA POR CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, LOS TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES DE VENTA, EL FINANCIAMIENTO DE CUALQUIER COMPRA A CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, LA ENTREGA, INTENTO DE ENTREGA O INSTALACIÓN DE SU MERCANCÍA, EL USO, RECOLECCIÓN O ALMACENAMIENTO DE INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL, O LOS TÉRMINOS DE USO O EL AVISO DE PRIVACIDAD, INCLUYENDO DISPUTAS O RECLAMACIONES BAJO LAS LEYES FEDERALES O ESTATALES, EL DERECHO CONSUETUDINARIO Y LAS LEYES DE RESPONSABILIDAD EXTRACONTRACTUAL ("DISPUTA"), DEBE RESOLVERSE EXCLUSIVAMENTE MEDIANTE UN ARBITRAJE DEFINITIVO Y VINCULANTE Y NO MEDIANTE TRIBUNALES O JURADOS. EL TÉRMINO “DISPUTA” Y EL REQUISITO DE ARBITRAR SE INTERPRETARÁN DE MANERA AMPLIA. INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE LO ANTERIOR, USTED O CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE PUEDEN OPTAR POR RESOLVER UNA DISPUTA EN UN TRIBUNAL DE RECLAMOS MENORES SI LA DISPUTA CALIFICA PARA TAL TRIBUNAL Y EL ASUNTO PROCEDE ÚNICAMENTE COMO CASO INDIVIDUAL (NO COLECTIVO NI REPRESENTATIVO) Y BUSCA COMPENSACIÓN INDIVIDUAL, SIEMPRE Y CUANDO LA ACCIÓN PERMANEZCA EN ESE TRIBUNAL Y NO SEA REMOVIDA NI APELADA EN UN TRIBUNAL DE JURISDICCIÓN GENERAL. ESTA ELECCIÓN PUEDE HACERSE EN CUALQUIER MOMENTO ANTES DE LA ASIGNACIÓN DE UN ÁRBITRO. USTED Y CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE ACEPTAN QUE AMBAS PARTES PODEMOS PRESENTAR UNA DEMANDA ANTE UN TRIBUNAL PARA QUE EMITA UNA MEDIDA CAUTELAR PARA EVITAR VIOLACIONES A LOS DERECHOS DE LA PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL U OTROS ABUSOS DE LA MISMA. ESTE ACUERDO DE ARBITRAJE Y RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS APLICA A LAS DISPUTAS QUE SURJAN ANTES, DURANTE O DESPUÉS DE LA FECHA DE SU COMPRA, INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE CUALQUIER GARANTÍA QUE ESTÉ VIGENTE, Y SOBREVIVE A LA CANCELACIÓN DE SU PEDIDO U OTRA RECISIÓN DE LOS ACUERDOS, INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTRAS, LA RECISIÓN DE LA GARANTÍA LIMITADA.Usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante renuncian al derecho a un juicio con jurado y a cualquier derecho a una audiencia de la Disputa en un tribunal, en la medida más amplia permitida por la ley. En el arbitraje, las disputas son resueltas por un árbitro neutro en lugar de un juez o jurado, los hallazgos son más limitados que en un tribunal, y la decisión del árbitro está sujeta a revisión limitada por los tribunales. El árbitro puede, en base individual, laudar los mismos daños y perjuicios e indemnizaciones que un tribunal en favor o en contra únicamente de las partes del arbitraje, incluyendo compensaciones monetarias por daños y perjuicios, medidas cautelares y de reparación declaratoria, y solo en la medida necesaria para proporcionar la indemnización justificada por la reclamación individual de la parte en cuestión. En ninguna circunstancia el árbitro podrá tomar decisiones sobre acciones colectivas. El árbitro debe regirse por los términos de los Acuerdos, tal y como lo haría un tribunal. El árbitro no puede considerar ninguna oferta de acuerdo previo al tomar su decisión. Independientemente de la forma en que se lleve a cabo el arbitraje, el árbitro emitirá una decisión por escrito y en la misma expondrá los resultados y las conclusiones esenciales en los que se basa el laudo. El laudo del arbitraje será vinculante únicamente entre las partes de este y no tendrá un efecto excluyente sobre ningún otro arbitraje o procedimiento que involucre a una parte distinta, siempre y cuando el árbitro pueda considerar fallos en otros arbitrajes que involucren a individuos distintos. La sentencia sobre el laudo del árbitro podrá registrarse en cualquier tribunal de jurisdicción competente. El arbitraje será conducido por un único árbitro de la American Arbitration Association (Asociación Americana de Arbitraje, "AAA") y el monto y la naturaleza de la indemnización no debe exceder la reparación establecida por las leyes aplicables. El arbitraje será conducido en el condado donde usted resida o en cualquier otra ubicación mutuamente acordada. Se aplicará el Reglamento de Arbitraje de Consumo de la AAA, según las modificaciones al mismo establecidas por este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. Si la AAA no aplica dicho reglamento, se aplicará el Reglamento de Arbitraje Comercial de la AAA, según las modificaciones al mismo establecidas por este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. El reglamento de la AAA y un formulario que puede utilizarse para iniciar los procedimientos de arbitraje están disponibles en www.adr.org. Usted y la Entidad Arbitrante acuerdan que, si por cualquier razón la AAA no lleva a cabo o no está disponible para llevar a cabo el arbitraje de conformidad con este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas, las partes acordarán una organización de arbitraje suplente. Si las partes no logran llegar a un acuerdo en este sentido, las partes deberán pedir a un tribunal de jurisdicción competente que les asigne una organización de arbitraje para que administre un procedimiento de conformidad con los términos del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. Las partes acuerdan además que la elección de la AAA como foro no es parte integral del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas.3.
Delegación/Arbitrabilidad. La Ley Federal de Arbitraje (“FAA”) se aplica sobre este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas exclusivamente y rige su interpretación y cumplimiento. Excepto si se especifica lo contrario en otra parte de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas, el árbitro, y no ningún tribunal o agencia local, estatal o federal, tendrá la facultad de decidir y decidirá sobre todos los asuntos o disputas relacionados con el significado, la validez, formación, exigibilidad, interpretación, alcance y aplicación de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas (incluida la cuestión de la posibilidad de someter a arbitraje), los Términos y Condiciones de Venta, los Términos de uso y el Aviso de Privacidad, salvo que un tribunal dirimirá cualquier cuestión relacionada con el significado, la validez y el cumplimiento de la Sección 4 del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas.4.
Renuncia a Demanda colectiva de arbitraje: Usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante acuerdan que el arbitraje se llevará a cabo únicamente en base individual y no en una base general colectiva, representativa, consolidada ni de abogado privado. Una Disputa no puede ser consolidada con una reclamación o revelación de documentos fundamentales realizada por una persona o entidad cualquiera que no forme parte del procedimiento de arbitraje. El árbitro no puede laudar compensación a ninguna persona o entidad que no sea una de las partes del procedimiento de arbitraje, y solo puede laudar dicha compensación según corresponda para proporcionar compensación a una de las partes del procedimiento de arbitraje. La renuncia a demandas colectivas y compensación colectiva es una parte fundamental de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas vinculante y no puede separarse del mismo. Si un tribunal determina que la renuncia a demandas colectivas y compensación colectiva no puede aplicarse a una reclamación o una solicitud de compensación en particular y todas las apelaciones a dicha decisión se han agotado (o la decisión es de forma otra definitiva), las partes acuerdan que esa reclamación o solicitud de compensación en particular se procese en tribunales pero que la misma deberá separarse y permanecer a la espera del arbitraje del resto de las reclamaciones.5.
Honorarios, costas y procedimientos relacionados con el arbitraje: A menos que se disponga lo contrario en el presente, todos los cargos de presentación, cargos administrativos y cargos y gastos del árbitro serán pagados de acuerdo con el reglamento aplicable de la AAA. Si el total de sus reclamaciones por daños y perjuicios es de $25,000 o menos, excluyendo los honorarios de sus abogados: (1) el árbitro puede laudarle a usted los honorarios razonables de abogados, honorarios de expertos y costas (en conjunto por hasta $10,000) si usted gana el arbitraje y si el laudo por su reclamación (excluyendo costas y honorarios) excede por 50 % la última oferta de la Entidad Arbitrante, oferta que no debe compartirse con el árbitro hasta luego del laudo; y (2) el árbitro podría no laudar a ninguna Entidad Arbitrante sus honorarios de abogados, honorarios de expertos o costas a si determina que su reclamación fue frívola, se presentó por un fin inadecuado o de mala fe o después de la aplicación de las disposiciones del Reglamento Federal del Procedimiento Civil 68, el cual se aplicará y deberá ser hecho valer por el árbitro. Si el total de las reclamaciones por daños y perjuicios de usted es más de $25,000, sin incluir los honorarios de sus abogados, el árbitro puede laudar a la parte vencedora la totalidad o parte de sus gastos razonables por concepto de honorarios de abogados, honorarios de expertos y costas, incluidos los cargos de la AAA, en la medida en que dichos cargos y costas si un tribunal pudiera laudarlos o si el árbitro determina que la reclamación o la defensa fue frívola o se presentó por un fin inadecuado o de mala fe o después de la aplicación de las disposiciones del Reglamento Federal del Procedimiento Civil 68, el cual se aplicará y deberá ser hecho valer por el árbitro. En arbitrajes llevados a cabo de conformidad con el Reglamento de Arbitraje de Consumo de la AAA, cuando no haya reclamaciones o contrarreclamaciones divulgadas que excedan los $25,000, la Disputa se solucionará mediante el envío de documentos únicamente/arbitraje de escritorio, excepto cuando cualquiera de las partes solicite una audiencia o el árbitro decida que es necesaria una audiencia. Si así lo solicita la Entidad Arbitrante, usted debe presentarse personal e individualmente (con su abogado si tiene uno) en una conferencia telefónica individualizada con un gerente de casos antes de que se asigne un árbitro. Si usted o cualquier Entidad Arbitrante presentan o causan que se presente ante un tribunal, agencia u otro tribunal arbitral cualquiera una Disputa que esté sujeta a arbitraje conforme a este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas (una "Demanda Arbitrable"), el demandado puede proporcionar una notificación por escrito al demandante (o su abogado) de su deber de someter a arbitraje la Demanda Arbitrable conforme a este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. Si el demandante no desestima la Demanda Arbitrable en un plazo de 14 días calendarios a partir de dicha notificación y el demandado tiene éxito con un recurso para forzar el cumplimiento de los términos de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas, el demandante será responsable de pagar los honorarios profesionales razonables de los abogados y otras costas en los que el demandado incurra al responder a la demanda y forzar el arbitraje de la Demanda Arbitrable. Cualquier solicitud por dichos honorarios y costas se dirigirá al árbitro y será este quien decida al respecto como si se tratase de una Disputa y de conformidad con este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas.6.
Reclamaciones masivas: Si un mismo abogado presenta veinticinco o más reclamaciones similares en contra de una o más Entidades Arbitrantes o si estas se coordinan (en colectivo, "Reclamaciones masivas"), usted entiende y acepta que la resolución de su reclamación podría retrasarse. Usted acepta también el siguiente proceso coordinado de casos de muestra (bellwether) y que su reclamación, así como todas las Reclamaciones masivas, estarán sujetas a la tabla de tarifas de Presentación de Múltiples Casos de Consumo de la AAA vigente al momento en el que se seleccionan las reclamaciones para los procedimientos de casos de muestra. El abogado de los demandantes y el abogado de las Entidades Arbitrantes deben seleccionar cada uno diez casos para procesarlos primero en el arbitraje en procedimientos de casos de muestra. El resto de los casos no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados en el arbitraje hasta tanto sean seleccionados para un procedimiento de casos de muestra. Si las partes no logran resolver los casos restantes luego de la conclusión de los procedimientos de casos de muestra iniciales, cada parte deberá seleccionar otros diez casos para proceder al arbitraje para un segundo conjunto de procedimientos de casos de muestra. Este proceso continuará así hasta que las partes logren resolver todas las reclamaciones, bien sea a través de acuerdos mutuos o el arbitraje. Solo se puede asignar un caso a cada árbitro como parte de este proceso. Se suspenderá la prescripción para las reclamaciones de un individuo hasta que el caso de dicho individuo se seleccione para un procedimiento de casos de muestra, se retire o se resuelva por otros medios. Un tribunal tendrá autoridad para obligar a que se cumpla lo estipulado en este párrafo y, de ser necesario, emitir una medida cautelar para evitar la presentación masiva de solicitudes de arbitraje en contra de las Entidades Arbitrantes.7.
Renuncia a demanda colectiva sin arbitraje y a jurado: Usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante aceptan que, en la mayor medida permitida por la ley, si por cualquier motivo procede una Disputa en tribunales en lugar del arbitraje: (1) usted y cualquier Entidad arbitrante renuncian al derecho a un juicio con jurado; (2) la Disputa procederá únicamente sobre una base individual, no colectiva ni representativa; y (3) ni usted ni ninguna Entidad arbitrante pueden ser miembros de una demanda colectiva o representativa, ni de otra forma participar en ningún procedimiento general colectivo, representativo, consolidado o de abogado privado.8.
Divisibilidad. Excepto por lo específicamente previsto en el presente documento, si alguna parte del Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas se considera inválida o imposible de hacer cumplir, dicha parte se eliminará y el resto del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas permanecerá en total vigor y efecto.9.
Cambios: Si en el futuro realizamos cambios a este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas (distinto a un cambio en la Dirección de Notificación), dichos cambios no aplicarán a ninguna Disputa para la cual usted ya haya entregado Notificación a cualquier Entidad Arbitrante.vTOSO211213spa

Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process. If you and any Arbitrating Entity (defined below) have a Dispute (defined below), the parties to the Dispute agree that they will make a good faith effort to resolve it informally. This process should lead to a resolution. In connection with any Dispute, a “Notice” must be sent to the other party that describes the Dispute. The Notice must include the claimant’s name, address, telephone number, email address, sufficient information to identify any transaction at issue; and a detailed description of (1) the Dispute, (2) the nature and basis of the claims, and (3) the nature and basis of the relief sought. The Notice must also verify that the information provided is true and accurate. The claimant must personally sign the Notice. You may send the Notice by email to: legalnotices@roomstogo.com or by mail to: Legal Department, 11540 Highway 92 East, Seffner, FL 33584. If an Arbitrating Entity has a Dispute with you, it will send the Notice to the address on file. After a Notice is received, you and the Arbitrating Entity agree to negotiate in good faith, including through an informal and individualized telephone conference between you and the Arbitrating Entity. If requested by the Arbitrating Entity, you must personally appear at and participate in the telephone conference (if you are represented by counsel, your counsel may also participate). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you and the Arbitrating Entity agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any formal dispute resolution proceeding, including a demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. If the sufficiency of a Notice or compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is at issue, it shall be decided by a court prior to the filing of any demand for arbitration.2. Mandatory Arbitration: AFTER EXHAUSTION OF THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS, YOU AND ANY “ARBITRATING ENTITY” (WHICH INCLUDES RTG, ANY THIRD PARTY THAT DELIVERS, SERVICES OR ATTEMPTS TO DELIVER OR SERVICE YOUR MERCHANDISE, AND ANY OF ITS OR THEIR AFFILIATES, AND ALL OF ITS OR THEIR PARENT COMPANIES, SUBSIDIARIES, DIVISIONS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, PARTNERS, TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS), AGREE THAT ANY UNRESOLVED DISPUTE OR CLAIM BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM THAT RELATES IN ANY WAY TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE SOLD, PERFORMED, OR DISTRIBUTED BY ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, ANY TRANSACTION WITH ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, ANY WARRANTY MADE BY ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE, TO THE FINANCING OF ANY PURCHASE FROM ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, THE DELIVERY, ATTEMPTED DELIVERY, OR INSTALLATION OF YOUR MERCHANDISE, TO THE USE, COLLECTION OR STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, OR THE TERMS OF USE OR THE PRIVACY NOTICE, INCLUDING DISPUTES OR CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL OR STATE STATUTES, COMMON LAW OR TORT LAW, WHETHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE (“DISPUTE”), MUST BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A COURT OR JURY. THE TERM “DISPUTE” AND THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL BE BROADLY INTERPRETED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU OR ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY MAY ELECT TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF THE DISPUTE QUALIFIES FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND THE MATTER PROCEEDS ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NOT A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS AND SEEKS INDIVIDUAL RELIEF SO LONG AS THE ACTION REMAINS IN THAT COURT AND IS NOT REMOVED OR APPEALED TO A COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION. THIS ELECTION MAY BE MADE AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ARBITRATOR. YOU AND ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY AGREE THAT WE EACH MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION/ARBITRATION AGREEMENT APPLIES TO DISPUTES ARISING BEFORE, ON, OR AFTER THE DATE OF YOUR PURCHASE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY WARRANTY IS IN EFFECT, AND IT SURVIVES CANCELLATION OF YOUR ORDER OR OTHER TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TERMINATION OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY.You and any Arbitrating Entity waive the right to a trial by jury and any right to have a Dispute heard in court to the fullest extent permitted by law. In arbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts. The arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court in favor of or against only the parties to the arbitration, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Under no circumstances may the arbitrator preside over any class or collective action. The arbitrator must follow the terms of the Agreements as a court would. The arbitrator may not consider any prior settlement offers in making the decision. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall be binding only among the parties to the arbitration and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. A single arbitrator with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will conduct the arbitration, and the amount and nature of the award may not exceed the relief allowed by applicable law. The arbitration will be conducted in the county of your residence or another mutually agreed location. The AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. If AAA will not apply those rules, then AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. The AAA’s rules and a form that can be used to initiate arbitration proceedings are available at www.adr.org. You and Arbitrating Entity agree that if for any reason AAA will not conduct or becomes unavailable to conduct the arbitration consistent with this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, then the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding consistent with the terms of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. The parties further agree that the choice of AAA as a forum is not integral to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.3. Delegation/Arbitrability. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement exclusively and governs its interpretation and enforcement. Except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the authority to decide, and shall decide, all issues or disputes relating to the meaning, validity, formation, enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (including “gateway” issues of arbitrability), the Terms and Conditions of Sale, the Limited Warranty, the Terms of Use, and the Privacy Notice, except that a court will resolve any question regarding the meaning, validity, or enforceability of Section 4 of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.4. Arbitration Class Action Waiver: You and any Arbitrating Entity agree that the arbitration will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not on a class, representative, consolidated, collective, or private attorney general basis. A Dispute may not be consolidated with a claim brought or discovery conducted by any person or entity that is not a party to the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a party to the arbitration proceeding and may only award such relief as is necessary to provide relief to a party to the arbitration proceeding. This waiver of class actions and collective relief is an essential part of this binding Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement and cannot be severed from it. If a court determines that the class action and collective relief waiver is not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief shall proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.5. Fees, Costs, and Procedures Relating to Arbitration: Except as otherwise provided herein, all filing fees, administrative fees, and arbitrator fees and expenses will be paid in accordance with the applicable AAA rules. If your total damage claims are $25,000 or less, not including your attorneys’ fees: (1) the arbitrator may award you your reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and costs (collectively up to $10,000) if you prevail in the arbitration and if your award on your claim (excluding costs and fees) exceeds by 50% the last offer from the Arbitrating Entity, which offer shall not be shared with arbitrator until after the award; and (2) the arbitrator may not award any Arbitrating Entity its attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and/or costs, including AAA fees unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith or after application of the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator. If your total damage claims are more than $25,000, not including your attorneys’ fees, then the arbitrator may award the prevailing party all or a portion of its reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and/or costs including AAA fees, to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court or if the arbitrator determines that a claim or defense was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith or after application of the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator. In arbitrations conducted under AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the Dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only/desk arbitration, except that any party may ask for a hearing or the arbitrator may decide that a hearing is necessary. If requested by the Arbitrating Entity, you shall individually and personally appear (with your counsel if you have one) at an individualized telephone conference with a case manager before an arbitrator is appointed.If You or any Arbitrating Entity files or causes to be filed in any court, agency, or other non-arbitral tribunal a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (an “Arbitrable Suit”), the defendant/respondent may provide written notice to the plaintiff/claimant (or its attorney) of its duty to arbitrate the Arbitrable Suit or comply with the informal dispute resolution process under this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. If the plaintiff/claimant does not dismiss the Arbitrable Suit within 14 calendar days of such notice, and the defendant/respondent successfully moves to compel compliance with the terms of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, the plaintiff/claimant shall be responsible for paying the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred by the defendant/respondent in responding to and moving to compel arbitration of the Arbitrable Suit. Any request for such fees and costs shall be addressed to and decided by an arbitrator as if it were a Dispute and otherwise in accordance with this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.6. Mass Claims: If twenty-five or more similar claims are asserted against one or more Arbitrating Entities by the same counsel or are otherwise coordinated (collectively, “Mass Claims”), you understand and agree that the resolution of your claim might be delayed. You also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process and that your claim, and all Mass Claims, shall be subject to the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule at the time the claims are selected for bellwether proceedings. Counsel for the claimants and counsel for the Arbitrating Entities shall each select ten cases to proceed first in arbitration in individual bellwether proceedings. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration until they are selected for a bellwether proceeding. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial bellwether proceedings, each side shall select another ten cases to proceed to arbitration for a second set of bellwether proceedings. This process shall continue until the parties are able to resolve all of the claims, either through settlement or arbitration. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of this process. The statute of limitations shall be tolled for an individual’s claims until the time the individual’s case is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against the Arbitrating Entities.7.

Algunos estados no permiten la exclusión o limitación de daños y perjuicios incidentales o indirectos, de modo que la limitación o exclusión que precede podría no aplicar para usted. Todas las disputas que surjan de esta Garantía Limitada estarán sujetas al Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas descrito a continuación. DURACIÓN DE LAS GARANTÍAS IMPLÍCITAS: RTG LIMITA DE MANERA EXPRESA LA DURACIÓN DE LAS GARANTÍAS IMPLÍCITAS DE COMERCIABILIDAD Y DE IDONEIDAD PARA CUALQUIER OBJETIVO PARTICULAR A LA DURACIÓN DEL PERÍODO DE GARANTÍA LIMITADA DE UN AÑO A PARTIR DE LA FECHA DE ENTREGA O RECOGIDA.

ALGUNOS ESTADOS NO PERMITEN LIMITAR LA DURACIÓN DE UNA GARANTÍA IMPLÍCITA, DE MODO QUE LA LIMITACIÓN QUE PRECEDE PODRÍA NO APLICAR PARA USTED. ESTA GARANTÍA LE CONCEDE DERECHOS LEGALES ESPECÍFICOS, Y USTED PODRÍA TENER TAMBIÉN OTROS DERECHOS QUE VARÍAN DE UN ESTADO A OTRO.ACUERDO DE ARBITRAJE Y RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS: LEA DETENIDAMENTE – ESTE ACUERDO AFECTA SUS DERECHOS LEGALESINDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE CUALQUIER LEY QUE INDIQUE LO CONTRARIO, USTED DEBE NOTIFICARNOS DE LA FORMA ESTABLECIDA EN ESTE ACUERDO DE ARBITRAJE Y RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS CUALQUIER RECLAMACIÓN DENTRO DEL PERÍODO DE UN AÑO A PARTIR DEL MOMENTO EN QUE SE PRODUCE, DE LO CONTRARIO, SU RECLAMACIÓN NO APLICARÁ Y QUEDARÁ VETADA POR EL TIEMPO TRANSCURRIDO EN LA MAYOR MEDIDA PERMITIDA POR LA LEY.1.
Proceso informal obligatorio para la resolución de disputas. Si usted o cualquier Entidad Arbitrante (como se define más adelante) tienen una Disputa (como se define más adelante), las partes de la Disputa aceptan que harán un esfuerzo de buena fe para resolverla de manera informal. Este proceso debería llevar a una resolución. En conexión con cualquier Disputa, se debe enviar una ("Notificación") a la otra parte en la que se describa la Disputa. La Notificación debe incluir el nombre, la dirección, el número telefónico, la dirección de correo electrónico del reclamante, así como suficiente información para identificar las transacciones que representan un problema. Todo esto además de una descripción detallada de (1) la Disputa, (2) la naturaleza y la base de las reclamaciones y (3) la naturaleza y base de la compensación que se busca. La Notificación debe verificar también que la información provista sea cierta y precisa. El reclamante debe firmar personalmente la Notificación. Usted puede enviar la Notificación por correo electrónico a: legalnotices@roomstogo.com o por correo postal a la dirección: Legal Department, 11540 Highway 92 East, Seffner, FL 33584. Si una Entidad Arbitrante tiene una Disputa con usted, esta le enviará la Notificación a la dirección que aparece en su archivo. Luego de recibida la Notificación, usted y la Entidad Arbitrante aceptan negociar de buena fe, incluso a través de una conferencia telefónica informal e individualizada entre usted y la Entidad Arbitrante. Si así lo solicita la Entidad Arbitrante, usted debe presentarse personalmente y participar en la conferencia telefónica (si usted cuenta con la representación de un abogado, su abogado también puede participar). Si la Disputa no se resuelve dentro de los sesenta (60) días posteriores a la recepción de la Notificación (período que puede extenderse si las partes así lo acuerdan), usted y la Entidad Arbitrante aceptan las disposiciones de resolución de disputas que se establecen más adelante. El cumplimiento y la realización de este proceso informal para la resolución de disputas es una condición previa para iniciar un proceso formal para la resolución de disputas, incluida una solicitud de arbitraje. La prescripción y cualquier plazo de cargos de presentación permanecerán suspendidos mientras las partes participan en este proceso informal para la resolución de disputas. Si la suficiencia de una Notificación o el cumplimiento de este proceso informal para la resolución de disputas son objeto de controversia, un tribunal deberá emitir una decisión al respecto antes de la presentación de una solicitud de arbitraje.2.
Arbitraje obligatorio: LUEGO DE AGOTAR EL PROCESO INFORMAL PARA LA RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS, USTED Y CUALQUIER "ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE" (QUE INCLUYE A RTG, CUALQUIER TERCERO QUE ENTREGUE, REPARE O INTENTE ENTREGAR O REPARAR LA MERCANCÍA DE USTED, Y CUALQUIERA DE SUS FILIALES, EMPRESAS MATRICES, SUBSIDIARIAS, DIVISIONES, ACCIONISTAS, MIEMBROS, GERENTES, SOCIOS, FIDEICOMISARIOS, DIRECTORES, EJECUTIVOS, EMPLEADOS, REPRESENTANTES, PREDECESORES, SUCESORES O CESIONARIOS) ACUERDAN QUE CUALQUIER DISPUTA O RECLAMACIÓN NO RESUELTA ENTRE USTED Y CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTRAS, CUALQUIER DISPUTA O RECLAMACIÓN QUE SE RELACIONE DE CUALQUIER FORMA CON SU RELACIÓN CON CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTROS, CUALQUIER PRODUCTO O SERVICIO VENDIDO, REALIZADO O DISTRIBUIDO POR CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, CUALQUIER TRANSACCIÓN CON CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, CUALQUIER GARANTÍA EMITIDA POR CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, LOS TÉRMINOS Y CONDICIONES DE VENTA, EL FINANCIAMIENTO DE CUALQUIER COMPRA A CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE, LA ENTREGA, INTENTO DE ENTREGA O INSTALACIÓN DE SU MERCANCÍA, EL USO, RECOLECCIÓN O ALMACENAMIENTO DE INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL, O LOS TÉRMINOS DE USO O EL AVISO DE PRIVACIDAD, INCLUYENDO DISPUTAS O RECLAMACIONES BAJO LAS LEYES FEDERALES O ESTATALES, EL DERECHO CONSUETUDINARIO Y LAS LEYES DE RESPONSABILIDAD EXTRACONTRACTUAL ("DISPUTA"), DEBE RESOLVERSE EXCLUSIVAMENTE MEDIANTE UN ARBITRAJE DEFINITIVO Y VINCULANTE Y NO MEDIANTE TRIBUNALES O JURADOS. EL TÉRMINO “DISPUTA” Y EL REQUISITO DE ARBITRAR SE INTERPRETARÁN DE MANERA AMPLIA. INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE LO ANTERIOR, USTED O CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE PUEDEN OPTAR POR RESOLVER UNA DISPUTA EN UN TRIBUNAL DE RECLAMOS MENORES SI LA DISPUTA CALIFICA PARA TAL TRIBUNAL Y EL ASUNTO PROCEDE ÚNICAMENTE COMO CASO INDIVIDUAL (NO COLECTIVO NI REPRESENTATIVO) Y BUSCA COMPENSACIÓN INDIVIDUAL, SIEMPRE Y CUANDO LA ACCIÓN PERMANEZCA EN ESE TRIBUNAL Y NO SEA REMOVIDA NI APELADA EN UN TRIBUNAL DE JURISDICCIÓN GENERAL. ESTA ELECCIÓN PUEDE HACERSE EN CUALQUIER MOMENTO ANTES DE LA ASIGNACIÓN DE UN ÁRBITRO. USTED Y CUALQUIER ENTIDAD ARBITRANTE ACEPTAN QUE AMBAS PARTES PODEMOS PRESENTAR UNA DEMANDA ANTE UN TRIBUNAL PARA QUE EMITA UNA MEDIDA CAUTELAR PARA EVITAR VIOLACIONES A LOS DERECHOS DE LA PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL U OTROS ABUSOS DE LA MISMA. ESTE ACUERDO DE ARBITRAJE Y RESOLUCIÓN DE DISPUTAS APLICA A LAS DISPUTAS QUE SURJAN ANTES, DURANTE O DESPUÉS DE LA FECHA DE SU COMPRA, INDEPENDIENTEMENTE DE CUALQUIER GARANTÍA QUE ESTÉ VIGENTE, Y SOBREVIVE A LA CANCELACIÓN DE SU PEDIDO U OTRA RECISIÓN DE LOS ACUERDOS, INCLUYENDO, ENTRE OTRAS, LA RECISIÓN DE LA GARANTÍA LIMITADA.Usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante renuncian al derecho a un juicio con jurado y a cualquier derecho a una audiencia de la Disputa en un tribunal, en la medida más amplia permitida por la ley. En el arbitraje, las disputas son resueltas por un árbitro neutro en lugar de un juez o jurado, la revelación de documentos fundamentales es más limitada que en un tribunal y la decisión del árbitro está sujeta a revisión limitada por los tribunales. El árbitro puede, en base individual, laudar los mismos daños y perjuicios e indemnizaciones que un tribunal en favor o en contra únicamente de las partes del arbitraje, incluyendo compensaciones monetarias por daños y perjuicios, medidas cautelares y de reparación declaratoria, y solo en la medida necesaria para proporcionar la indemnización justificada por la reclamación individual de la parte en cuestión. En ninguna circunstancia el árbitro podrá tomar decisiones sobre acciones colectivas. El árbitro debe regirse por los términos de los Acuerdos, tal y como lo haría un tribunal. El árbitro no puede considerar ninguna oferta de acuerdo previo al tomar su decisión. Independientemente de la forma en que se lleve a cabo el arbitraje, el árbitro emitirá una decisión por escrito y en la misma expondrá los resultados y las conclusiones esenciales en los que se basa el laudo. El laudo del arbitraje será vinculante únicamente entre las partes de este y no tendrá un efecto excluyente sobre ningún otro arbitraje o procedimiento que involucre a una parte distinta, siempre y cuando el árbitro pueda considerar fallos en otros arbitrajes que involucren a individuos distintos. La sentencia sobre el laudo del árbitro podrá registrarse en cualquier tribunal de jurisdicción competente. El arbitraje será conducido por un único árbitro de la American Arbitration Association (Asociación Americana de Arbitraje, "AAA") y el monto y la naturaleza del laudo no debe exceder la compensación establecida por las leyes aplicables. El arbitraje será conducido en el condado donde usted resida o en cualquier otra ubicación mutuamente acordada. Se aplicará el Reglamento de Arbitraje de Consumo de la AAA, según las modificaciones al mismo establecidas por este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. Si la AAA no aplica dicho reglamento, se aplicará el Reglamento de Arbitraje Comercial de la AAA, según las modificaciones al mismo establecidas por este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. El reglamento de la AAA y un formulario que puede utilizarse para iniciar los procedimientos de arbitraje están disponibles en www.adr.org. Usted y la Entidad Arbitrante acuerdan que si por cualquier razón la AAA no lleva a cabo o no está disponible para llevar a cabo el arbitraje de conformidad con este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas las partes acordarán una organización de arbitraje suplente. Si las partes no logran llegar a un acuerdo en este sentido, las partes deberán pedir a un tribunal de jurisdicción competente que les asigne una organización de arbitraje para que administre un procedimiento de conformidad con los términos del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. Las partes acuerdan además que la elección de la AAA como foro no es parte integral del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas.3.
Delegación/Arbitrabilidad. La Ley Federal de Arbitraje (“FAA”) se aplica sobre este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas exclusivamente y rige su interpretación y cumplimiento. Excepto si se especifica lo contrario en otra parte de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas, el árbitro, y no ningún tribunal o agencia local, estatal o federal, tendrá la facultad de decidir y decidirá sobre todos los asuntos o disputas relacionados con el significado, la validez, formación, exigibilidad, interpretación, alcance y aplicación de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas (incluida la cuestión de la posibilidad de someter a arbitraje), los Términos y Condiciones de Venta y la Garantía Limitada, los Términos de uso y el Aviso de Privacidad, salvo que un tribunal dirimirá cualquier cuestión relacionada con el significado, la validez y el cumplimiento de la Sección 4 del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas.4.
Renuncia al arbitraje de demandas colectivas: Usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante acuerdan que el arbitraje se llevará a cabo únicamente en base individual y no en una base general colectiva, representativa, consolidada ni de abogado privado. Una Disputa no puede ser consolidada con una reclamación o revelación de documentos fundamentales realizada por una persona o entidad cualquiera que no forme parte del procedimiento de arbitraje. El árbitro no puede laudar compensación a ninguna persona o entidad que no sea una de las partes del procedimiento de arbitraje, y solo puede laudar dicha compensación según corresponda para proporcionar compensación a una de las partes del procedimiento de arbitraje. La renuncia a demandas colectivas y compensación colectiva es una parte fundamental de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas vinculante y no puede separarse del mismo. Si un tribunal determina que la renuncia a demandas colectivas y compensación colectiva no puede aplicarse a una reclamación o una solicitud de compensación en particular y todas las apelaciones a dicha decisión se han agotado (o la decisión es de forma otra definitiva), las partes acuerdan que esa reclamación o solicitud de compensación en particular se procese en tribunales pero que la misma deberá separarse y permanecer a la espera del arbitraje del resto de las reclamaciones.5.
Honorarios, costas y procedimientos relacionados con el arbitraje: A menos que se disponga lo contrario en el presente, todos los cargos de presentación, cargos administrativos y cargos y gastos del árbitro serán pagados de acuerdo con el reglamento aplicable de la AAA. Si el total de sus reclamaciones por daños y perjuicios es de $25,000 o menos, sin incluir los honorarios de sus abogados: (1) el árbitro puede laudarle a usted los honorarios razonables de abogados, honorarios de expertos y costas (en conjunto por hasta $10,000) si usted gana el arbitraje y si el laudo por su reclamación (excluyendo costas y honorarios) excede por 50 % la última oferta de la Entidad Arbitrante, oferta que no debe compartirse con el árbitro hasta luego del laudo; y (2) el árbitro podría no laudar a ninguna Entidad Arbitrante sus honorarios de abogados, honorarios de expertos o costas a si determina que su reclamación fue frívola, se presentó por un fin inadecuado o de mala fe o después de la aplicación de las disposiciones del Reglamento Federal del Procedimiento Civil 68, el cual se aplicará y deberá ser hecho valer por el árbitro. Si el total de las reclamaciones por daños y perjuicios de usted es más de $25,000, sin incluir los honorarios de sus abogados, el árbitro puede laudar a la parte vencedora la totalidad o parte de sus gastos razonables por concepto de honorarios de abogados, honorarios de expertos y costas, incluidos los cargos de la AAA, en la medida en que dichos cargos y costas si un tribunal pudiera laudarlos o si el árbitro determina que la reclamación o la defensa fue frívola o se presentó por un fin inadecuado o de mala fe o después de la aplicación de las disposiciones del Reglamento Federal del Procedimiento Civil 68, el cual se aplicará y deberá ser hecho valer por el árbitro. En arbitrajes llevados a cabo de conformidad con el Reglamento de Arbitraje de Consumo de la AAA, cuando no haya reclamaciones o contrarreclamaciones divulgadas que excedan los $25,000, la Disputa se solucionará mediante el envío de documentos únicamente/arbitraje de escritorio, excepto cuando cualquiera de las partes solicite una audiencia o el árbitro decida que es necesaria una audiencia. Si así lo solicita la Entidad Arbitrante, usted debe presentarse personal e individualmente (con su abogado si tiene uno) en una conferencia telefónica individualizada con un gerente de casos antes de que se asigne un árbitro.Si usted o cualquier Entidad Arbitrante presentan o causan que se presente ante un tribunal, agencia u otro tribunal arbitral cualquiera una Disputa que esté sujeta a arbitraje conforme a este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas (una "Demanda Arbitrable"), el demandado puede proporcionar una notificación por escrito al demandante (o su abogado) de su deber de someter a arbitraje la Demanda Arbitrable conforme a este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas. Si el demandante no desestima la Demanda Arbitrable en un plazo de 14 días calendarios a partir de dicha notificación y el demandado tiene éxito con un recurso para forzar el cumplimiento de los términos de este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas, el demandante será responsable de pagar los honorarios profesionales razonables de los abogados y otras costas en los que el demandado incurra al responder a la demanda y forzar el arbitraje de la Demanda Arbitrable. Cualquier solicitud por dichos honorarios y costas se dirigirá al árbitro y será este quien decida al respecto como si se tratase de una Disputa y de conformidad con este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas.6.
Reclamaciones masivas: Si un mismo abogado presenta veinticinco o más reclamaciones similares en contra de una o más Entidades Arbitrantes o si estas se coordinan (en colectivo, "Reclamaciones masivas"), usted entiende y acepta que la resolución de su reclamación podría retrasarse. Usted acepta también el siguiente proceso coordinado de casos de muestra (bellwether) y que su reclamación, así como todas las Reclamaciones masivas, estarán sujetas a la tabla de tarifas de Presentación de Múltiples Casos de Consumo de la AAA vigente al momento en el que se seleccionan las reclamaciones para los procedimientos de casos de muestra. El abogado de los demandantes y el abogado de las Entidades Arbitrantes deben seleccionar cada uno diez casos para procesarlos primero en el arbitraje en procedimientos de casos de muestra individuales. El resto de los casos no se presentarán ni se considerarán presentados en el arbitraje hasta tanto sean seleccionados para un procedimiento de casos de muestra. Si las partes no logran resolver los casos restantes luego de la conclusión de los procedimientos de casos de muestra iniciales, cada parte deberá seleccionar otros diez casos para proceder al arbitraje para un segundo conjunto de procedimientos de casos de muestra. Este proceso continuará así hasta que las partes logren resolver todas las reclamaciones, bien sea a través de acuerdos mutuos o el arbitraje. Solo se puede asignar un caso a cada árbitro como parte de este proceso. Se suspenderá la prescripción para las reclamaciones de un individuo hasta que el caso de dicho individuo se seleccione para un procedimiento de casos de muestra, se retire o se resuelva por otros medios. Un tribunal tendrá autoridad para obligar a que se cumpla lo estipulado en este párrafo y, de ser necesario, emitir una medida cautelar para evitar la presentación masiva de solicitudes de arbitraje en contra de las Entidades Arbitrantes.7.
Renuncia a demandas colectivas sin arbitraje y juicio con jurado: Usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante aceptan que, en la mayor medida permitida por la ley, si por cualquier motivo procede una Disputa en tribunales en lugar del arbitraje: (1) usted y cualquier Entidad Arbitrante renuncian al derecho a un juicio con jurado; (2) la Disputa procederá únicamente sobre una base individual, no colectiva ni representativa; y (3) ni usted ni ninguna Entidad Arbitrante pueden ser miembros de una demanda colectiva o representativa, ni de otra forma participar en ningún procedimiento general colectivo, representativo, consolidado o de abogado privado.8.
Divisibilidad. Excepto por lo específicamente previsto en el presente documento, si alguna parte del Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas se considera inválida o imposible de hacer cumplir, dicha parte se eliminará y el resto del presente Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas permanecerá en total vigor y efecto.9.
Cambios: Si en el futuro realizamos cambios a este Acuerdo de Arbitraje y Resolución de Disputas (distinto a un cambio en la Dirección de Notificación), dichos cambios no aplicarán a ninguna Disputa para la cual usted ya haya entregado Notificación a cualquier Entidad Arbitrante.

IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY LAW TO THE CONTRARY, YOU MUST PROVIDE NOTICE TO US, PURSUANT TO THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION/ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, OF ANY CLAIM WITHIN ONE YEAR OF ITS ACCRUAL OR YOUR CLAIM SHALL BE WAIVED AND TIME-BARRED, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.A. Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process. If you and any Arbitrating Entity (defined below) have a Dispute (defined below), the parties to the Dispute agree that they will make a good faith effort to resolve it informally. This process should lead to a resolution. In connection with any Dispute, a notice (“Notice”) must be sent to the other party that describes the Dispute. The Notice must include your name, address, telephone number, email address, sufficient information for the Arbitrating Entity to identify any transaction at issue; and a detailed description of (1) your Dispute, (2) the nature and basis of your claims, and (3) the nature and basis of the relief sought. The Notice must also verify that the information provided is true and accurate. You may send the Notice by email to: legalnotices@roomstogo.com or by mail to: Legal Department, 11540 Highway 92 East, Seffner, FL 33584. You must personally sign the Notice. If an Arbitrating Entity has a Dispute with you, it will send the Notice to the address on file. After a Notice is received, you and the Arbitrating Entity agree to negotiate in good faith, including through an informal and individualized telephone conference between you and the Arbitrating Entity. If requested by the Arbitrating Entity, you must personally appear at and participate in the telephone conference (if you are represented by counsel, your counsel may also participate). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you and the Arbitrating Entity agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to filing any formal dispute resolution proceeding, including a demand for arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. If the sufficiency of a Notice or compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is at issue, it shall be decided by a court prior to the filing of any demand for arbitration.B. Mandatory Arbitration. AFTER EXHAUSTION OF THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS, YOU AND ANY “ARBITRATING ENTITY” (WHICH INCLUDES RTG, ANY THIRD PARTY DELIVERY SERVICE PROVIDER THAT DELIVERS OR ATTEMPTS TO DELIVER YOUR MERCHANDISE, AND ANY OF ITS OR THEIR AFFILIATES, PARENT COMPANIES, SUBSIDIARIES, DIVISIONS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, PARTNERS, TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, PREDECESSORS, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS) AGREE THAT ANY UNRESOLVED DISPUTE OR CLAIM BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM THAT RELATES IN ANY WAY TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE SOLD, PERFORMED, OR DISTRIBUTED BY ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, ANY TRANSACTION WITH ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, ANY WARRANTY MADE BY ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE, TO THE FINANCING OF ANY PURCHASE FROM ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY, THE DELIVERY, ATTEMPTED DELIVERY, OR INSTALLATION OF YOUR MERCHANDISE, TO THE USE, COLLECTION OR STORAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, OR THE TERMS OF USE OR THE PRIVACY NOTICE, INCLUDING DISPUTES OR CLAIMS UNDER FEDERAL OR STATE STATUTES, COMMON LAW, OR TORT LAW, WHETHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE ("DISPUTE") MUST BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A COURT OR JURY. THE TERM “DISPUTE” AND THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL BE BROADLY INTERPRETED. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU OR ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY MAY ELECT TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF THE DISPUTE QUALIFIES FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AND THE MATTER PROCEEDS ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NOT A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS AND SEEKS INDIVIDUAL RELIEF SO LONG AS THE ACTION REMAINS IN THAT COURT AND IS NOT REMOVED OR APPEALED TO A COURT OF GENERAL JURISDICTION. THIS ELECTION MAY BE MADE AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT OF AN ARBITRATOR. YOU AND ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY AGREE THAT WE EACH MAY BRING SUIT IN COURT TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION/ARBITRATION AGREEMENT APPLIES TO DISPUTES ARISING BEFORE, ON, OR AFTER THE DATE OF YOUR VISIT TO THE SITE OR THE DATE OF YOUR PURCHASE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY WARRANTY IS IN EFFECT, AND IT SURVIVES CANCELLATION OF YOUR ORDER OR OTHER TERMINATION OF ANY AGREEMENT YOU MAY HAVE WITH ANY ARBITRATING ENTITY.You and any Arbitrating Entity waive the right to a trial by jury and any right to have a Dispute heard in court to the fullest extent permitted by law. In arbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts. The arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court, in favor or against only the parties to the arbitration, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. Under no circumstances may the arbitrator preside over any class or collective action. The arbitrator must follow the terms of these terms as a court would. The arbitrator may not consider any prior settlement offers in making the decision. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitration award shall be binding only among the parties to the arbitration and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party, provided that the arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different individuals. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. A single arbitrator with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will conduct the arbitration, and the amount and nature of the award may not exceed the relief allowed by applicable law. The arbitration will be conducted in the county of your residence or another mutually agreed location. The AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. If AAA will not apply those rules, then AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply as modified by this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. The AAA's rules and a form that can be used to initiate arbitration proceedings are available at http://www.adr.org. You and Arbitrating Entity agree that if for any reason AAA will not conduct or becomes unavailable to conduct the arbitration consistent with this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, then the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding consistent with the terms of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. The parties further agree that the choice of AAA as a forum is not integral to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.C. Delegation/Arbitrability. The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") applies to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement exclusively and governs its interpretation and enforcement. Except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the authority to decide, and shall decide, all issues or disputes relating to the meaning, validity, formation, enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (including “gateway” issues of arbitrability), the Terms of Use, the Privacy Notice, and the Online Terms and Conditions of Sale, except that a court will resolve any question regarding the meaning, validity, or enforceability of Section D of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.D. Arbitration Class Action Waiver. You and any Arbitrating Entity agree that the arbitration will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not on a class, representative, consolidated, collective, or private attorney general basis. A Dispute may not be consolidated with a claim brought or discovery conducted by any person or entity that is not a party to the arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a party to the arbitration proceeding and may only award such relief as is necessary to provide relief to a party to the arbitration proceeding. This waiver of class actions and collective relief is an essential part of this binding Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement and cannot be severed from it. If a court determines that the class action and collective relief waiver is not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief shall proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.E. Fees, Costs and Procedures Relating to Arbitration. Except as otherwise provided herein, all filing fees, administrative fees, and arbitrator fees and expenses will be paid in accordance with the applicable AAA rules. If your total damage claims are $25,000 or less, not including your attorneys' fees: (1) the arbitrator may award you your reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, and costs (collectively up to $10,000) if you prevail in the arbitration and if your award on your claim (excluding costs and fees) exceeds by 50% the last offer from the Arbitrating Entity, which offer shall not be shared with arbitrator until after the award; and (2) the arbitrator may not award any Arbitrating Entity its attorneys' fees, expert fees, and/or costs, including AAA fees, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith or after application of the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator.
If your total damage claims are more than $25,000, not including your attorneys' fees, then the arbitrator may award the prevailing party all or a portion of its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, and/or costs, including AAA fees, to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court or if the arbitrator determines that a claim or defense was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith or after application of the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, which shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator. In arbitrations conducted under AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules, where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the Dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only/desk arbitration, except that any party may ask for a hearing or the arbitrator may decide that a hearing is necessary. If requested by the Arbitrating Entity, you shall individually and personally appear (with your counsel if you have one) at an individualized telephone conference with a case manager before an arbitrator is appointed.If You or any Arbitrating Entity files or causes to be filed in any court, agency, or other non-arbitral tribunal a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (an “Arbitrable Suit”), the defendant/respondent may provide written notice to the plaintiff/claimant (or its attorney) of its duty to arbitrate the Arbitrable Suit or comply with the informal dispute resolution process under this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. If the plaintiff/claimant does not dismiss the Arbitrable Suit within 14 calendar days of such notice, and the defendant/respondent successfully moves to compel compliance with the terms of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement, the plaintiff/claimant shall be responsible for paying the reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred by the defendant/respondent in responding to and moving to compel arbitration of the Arbitrable Suit. Any request for such fees and costs shall be addressed to and decided by an arbitrator as if it were a Dispute and otherwise in accordance with this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement.F. Mass Claims: If twenty-five or more similar claims are asserted against one or more Arbitrating Entities by the same counsel or are otherwise coordinated (collectively, “Mass Claims”), you understand and agree that the resolution of your claim might be delayed. You also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process. Counsel for the claimants and counsel for the Arbitrating Entities shall each select ten cases to proceed first in arbitration in a bellwether proceeding. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration until they are selected for a bellwether proceeding. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the conclusion of the initial bellwether proceeding, each side shall select another ten cases to proceed to arbitration for a second bellwether proceeding. This process shall continue until the parties are able to resolve all of the claims, either through settlement or arbitration. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of this process. The statute of limitations shall be tolled for an individual’s claims until the time the individual’s case is selected for a bellwether proceeding, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court shall have authority to enforce this paragraph and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing of arbitration demands against the Arbitrating Entities.G. Non-Arbitration Class Action and Jury Waiver. You and any Arbitrating Entity agree to the fullest extent permitted by law, that if for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration: (1) you and any Arbitrating Entity waive any right to a jury trial; (2) the Dispute will proceed solely on an individual, non-class, non-representative basis; and (3) neither you nor any Arbitrating Entity may be a class representative or class member or otherwise participate in any class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general proceeding.H. Severability. Except as specifically provided herein, if any part of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, then it shall be stricken and the other parts of this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.I. Changes: If we make any future changes to this Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), they shall not apply to any Dispute for which you have previously provided Notice to any Arbitrating Entity.17.

The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be conducted in the county of Your residence or another mutually agreed location. The AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply. If AAA will not apply those rules, then AAA’s CommercialArbitrationRules will apply. The AAA’s rules and a formthat can be used to initiate arbitration proceedings are available at www.adr.org. The parties agree that if for any reason AAA will not conduct or becomes unavailable to conduct the arbitration, then a court may appoint a substitute arbitrator, and further agree that the choice of AAA as a forum is not integral to the Agreement. In addition, except as expressly stated in the Class Action Waiver or otherwise expressly stated herein, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the enforcement, applicability (including issues of arbitrability), scope, validity, and interpretation of this dispute resolution/arbitration agreement, including but not limited to any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the dispute resolution/arbitration agreement is void, voidable or otherwise invalid. Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, each of the parties retains the right to seek remedies in small claims court to resolve any Claim, on an individual basis, within the jurisdiction of small claims court. You acknowledge Your understanding that all parties hereunder are waiving their rights to go to court, except for small claims court, to resolve any Claims arising under or related in any way to this Plan. If Your dispute is for $25,000.00 or less (not including attorney’s fees), the arbitration will be conducted by submitting documents to the arbitrator, unless You request an in-person or telephonic hearing or the arbitrator decides that a hearing is necessary. If Your dispute is for more than $25,000.00, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies to this agreement and governs its interpretation and enforcement. To the extent the FAA does not apply, the laws of the state where You purchased this Plan apply. 2. Class ActionWaiver: You andWe agree that the arbitration will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not on or as a class, representative, collective, consolidated private attorney general action or on behalf of the general public or similar proceeding (collectively “Class Action”). A Claim may not be consolidated with the Claim or discovery of any other party. The arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a party to the arbitration proceeding andmay only award such relief as is necessary to provide relief to a party to the arbitration proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a court will resolve any question regarding the meaning, validity or enforceability of this Class Action Waiver. If a court deems any portion of this Section 2 Class Action Waiver invalid or unenforceable, then Sections 1 and 3 of this dispute resolution/arbitration agreement will be null and void and any Claims shall proceed in a court and not in arbitration. 3. Fees and Costs in Arbitration: We will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration, unless Your dispute is found by the arbitrator to have been frivolous, filed in bad faith, or for the purpose of harassment. In that case, the AAA rules govern payment of such fees. Any award of attorney’s fees and costs to You shall be at the discretion of the arbitrator, except that: (1) the arbitrator may not award fees and costs to Us for an arbitration where the claimed damages are less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), unless the arbitrator determines that Your claim was frivolous or brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment.4. Non-arbitration Class Action and JuryWaiver: You and We agree that if for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than arbitration: (a) You and We waive any right to a jury trial; (b) the Claim will proceed solely on an individual, non-class, non-representative, non-collective, basis, and (c) neither You nor We may be a class representative or class member or otherwise participate in any class, representative, collective, consolidated, or private attorney general proceeding. 5. Severability: If any part of this dispute resolution/arbitration agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, then the other parts of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect except that if any part of Section 2 (Class Action Waiver) is found invalid or unenforceable, then Sections 1 and 3 of the dispute resolution/arbitration agreement will be null and void and the other parts of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 6. Opt-Out: YOU SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION/ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BY PROVIDING WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR INTENTION TO DO SO TO US WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE PURCHASE OF THE PLAN (THE DATE OF PURCHASE BEING INDICATED ON YOUR RECEIPT). To opt out, You must send written notice to the Administrator, Guardian Protection Products, Inc., P.O. Box 300, Hickory, NC 28603-0300, with the subject line, “Arbitration Opt Out.” You must include: (a) Your name and address; (b) the date You purchased this Plan; and (c) the Retailer’s name. If You properly and timely opt out, then all claims may be resolved in court rather than arbitration. Where the Furniture Item was acquired under an RTO Transaction, only the Lessee (and not the Lessor) under the RTO Transaction may opt-out pursuant to the terms of this provision, and the Lessor shall be bound by the Lessee’s decision whether to opt out.
