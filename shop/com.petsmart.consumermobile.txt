PetSmart Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 21, 2022
This Privacy Policy explains how PetSmart LLC and our subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively "PetSmart",

contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, apply for a job with us, or otherwise interact with us (collectively, the "Services").
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we
will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with
additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification). We
encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to
stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

Collection of Information
Information You Provide to Us
We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect
information when you create an account, fill out a form, participate in a survey, review, contest, or
promotion, make a purchase, apply for a job, upload your resume, communicate with us via third party
social media sites, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we
may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, credit card and other payment
information, age, location, your pet’s information (name, breed, date of birth, gender, etc.) and any other
information you choose to provide.
Other Information We Collect
When you access or use our Services or transact business with us, we
automatically collect information about you, including:
Transactional Information: When you make a purchase or return, we collect information about the
transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and date and location of the transaction.
Log Information: We collect information related to your access to and use of the Services, including the
type of browser you use, app version, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, site interaction data, and the page you
visited before navigating to our Services.
Session Replay Information: We use session replay software to collect information on how customers navigate our website and to improve its functionality.
Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our
Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and
mobile network information.
Visual Information: We utilize cameras in our stores for security purposes and to measure and observe
customer traffic patterns to improve our stores and services. We do not collect any biometric information.
Location Information: We may derive the approximate location of your device from your IP address. In
accordance with your device permissions, we may also collect information about the precise location of
your device. You have the ability to stop the collection of location information at any time
(see Your Choices below for details).
Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We (and our service providers) use
different technologies to collect information, including cookies and web beacons and other tracking mechanisms. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in your device memory that help us improve our Services and your
experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. Web beacons
(also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") are electronic images that may be used
in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and help us understand usage and campaign
effectiveness. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see Your Choices below.
Information Collected from Other Sources
We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may collect
information about you from third parties, such as mailing list providers and data enhancement sources. The information
we collect from those sources may include demographic information such as your gender and, in some cases, race/ethnicity.
We also collect information from publicly available sources, including information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog,
chat room, or social media). If you apply for a job with us, we will receive your application information from our job applicant
processing partners. Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a social media site or app, we may have access
to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information, and friend lists, in accordance with the
authorization procedures determined by such social media site or app.
Use of Information
We use the information we collect to deliver the products and services you
request and customize your experience with us. We also use the information we collect to:
Provide, maintain and improve our products and services;
Conduct audits related to a current interaction with the customer and concurrent transactions,
including, but not limited to, counting ad impressions to unique visitors, verifying positioning and
quality of ad impressions, and auditing compliance with this specification and other standards;
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, and
protect the rights and property of PetSmart and others;
Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
For limited, internal and operational use, such as to enable our website to function;
Perform services on behalf of us or a service provider, including maintaining or servicing accounts,
providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer
information, processing payments, providing financing, providing advertising or marketing services, or
conducting analytic services;
Undertake internal research for technological development and demonstration;
Undertake activities to verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that we own,
manufacture, or control, and to improve, upgrade, or enhance the service or device that is owned,
manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by, us;
Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages and to
respond to your comments, questions, and customer service requests;
Communicate with you about products, services, and events offered by PetSmart and others, and provide
news and information we think will be of interest to you (see Your Choices
below for information about how to opt out of these communications at any time);
Personalize your online experience and the advertisements you see when you use the Services or
third-party platforms based on your preferences, interests, and browsing and purchasing behavior;
Facilitate contests, sweepstakes, and promotions and process and deliver entries and rewards;
Create de-identified, anonymized, or aggregated information that we process only in a de-identified fashion and will not attempt to re-identify except as permitted by law;
Evaluate your application and qualifications for employment with us; and
Carry out any other purpose described to you at the time the information was collected.
Disclosure of Information
We may disclose your personal information as follows:
To vendors, service providers, and consultants that perform services for us, including e-mail and mobile marketing, analytics, web hosting, call center services, payment processing, coupon delivery, and data enhancement;
To entities who may provide financing for your purchase;
To the public, if you post information online and elect to make it available to the public, such as by writing a product review on our website;
In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;
To detect fraud, or if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, if we believe you have violated the law, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of PetSmart or others;
In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company;
Between and among PetSmart and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership; and
With your consent or at your direction.
We may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Privacy Policies
The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools, which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit their privacy policies.
