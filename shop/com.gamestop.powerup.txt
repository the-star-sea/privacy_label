How We Protect Your Personal Information
Security:
We implement appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information. However, no method or transmission over the internet or electronic system is completely secure, so there is no guarantee that data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed in connection with a breach of our physical, technical, organizational, or managerial safeguards.
Choosing a Password:
When you register as a user and create an online account on our Website, you will be prompted to select a personal password. To maximize your level of protection, you should choose a strong and unique password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and any account information.

Links to Third-Party Websites
Links to third-party websites are provided as a convenience to you. Once you leave our website, we neither control nor have responsibility for third-party sites, their content, or their privacy practices. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party service that you access or utilize. Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our website. Please be aware that you are providing your Personal Information to these third parties and not to one of our websites.
8.
Retention of Personal Information
We retain your personal information only for as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and/or accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator, or other government authority.
To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other applicable obligations.
Therefore, we retain personal information for as long as you use our services for the purposes explained in our Privacy Policy, including maintaining a user account. When you discontinue the use of our services, we will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as for any additional purpose based on the choices you have made, such as to receive marketing communications.
Once retention of your personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the personal information or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.

California Sale or Sharing of Personal Information
We may allow certain third parties (such as certain advertising partners) to collect your personal information via automated technologies on our websites and applications in exchange for non-monetary consideration (such as an enhanced ability to serve you content and targeted advertisements that may be of interest to you).
To opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of your personal information, click here:
You can also choose to opt out by clicking the ’Your Privacy Choices’ link at the bottom of the pages of our website, or go to the ‘Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information’ or ‘Your Privacy Choices’ option in the Account menu of the GameStop mobile app, and following the on-screen instructions. GameStop also recognizes the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal which will direct a user to follow onscreen instructions to opt-out from the Sale and Sharing of your personal information for the browser that sends this signal.
Expand for more information
California law defines the Sale of your information and Sharing of your information for cross-context behavioral broadly. Depending on the product/services you use and how you use them, we may have Sold or Shared, the following categories of personal information about you in the last 12 months to categories of third-parties such as data analytics providers and advertising networks: Identifying information, connection or usage data, cookie or device information, browser or device fingerprints, IP or approximate geolocation information, commercial information, browsing history, and inferences drawn from this data.
When you opt-out we will place a cookie on your device to identify and register your preference. This only applies to the browser you were using and only for the device you were using at the time you registered your preference. If you access GameStop websites from other browsers or devices, you will also need to make this selection on each browser and device. If you clear cookies on your browser after opt-out, your browser will no longer remember your preference, and you will need to reset your preference.
GameStop recognizes the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal which will direct a user to follow onscreen instructions to opt-out from the Sale and Sharing of your personal information for the browser that sends this signal. You will need to turn this on for each browser you use. To learn more about the GPC, visit the Global Privacy Control website.
For our GameStop mobile application, go to the ’Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information‘ or ‘Your Privacy Choices’ option in the Account menu, and follow onscreen instructions.

California Notice of Financial Incentive
GameStop may provide special offers and benefits to customers who participate in our Loyalty Program or sign up to receive communications from us via email, text, chat, and social media. The information we request from customers when they sign up may include the customer’s email address or phone number as well as name, partial birthdate, product preferences, or other information that allows us to tailor our communications. These incentives may result in differences in our prices or services offered to consumers and may include lower price for goods and services (e.g., discounts and other promotions).
Expand for more information
Participating in any financial incentive program is entirely optional and participants may withdraw from the program at any time. California Consumers may opt-in online or in stores and can opt out of the programs at any time by using the unsubscribe methods provided for that communication channel such as unsubscribe links in email messages.
Each financial incentive or price or service difference related to the collection and use of personal information is based upon our reasonable, good-faith determination of the estimated value of such information to our business, taking into consideration the value of the offer itself and the anticipated revenue generation that may be realized by rewarding brand loyalty and repeat purchases. We calculate the value of the offer and financial incentive by using the expense related to the offer.
