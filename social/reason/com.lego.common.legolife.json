The generated privacy label seems to be more comprehensive and detailed than the original privacy label. It includes more specific types of data collected and the purposes for their collection. It also includes more security practices, such as encrypting data at rest and limiting data access. The privacy policy provides more information about the company's practices, including their use of data brokers and aggregators, as well as their efforts to safeguard children's data. Therefore, it can be said that the generated privacy label is better as it provides a more detailed and comprehensive account of the data usage practices of the company.
