The generated privacy label is better because it provides more detailed information about the collected data and the security practices. It clearly states that chat messages (text and multimedia) are collected for backup and recovery purposes and are saved locally on the device, which is important for users to know. Additionally, it mentions commercially acceptable means of protecting user data and children's privacy protection, which are essential practices for maintaining user trust. The original privacy label lacks specific information about the collected data and only mentions two security practices, whereas the generated label provides more comprehensive information about the data collection and includes more security practices. Moreover, the generated privacy label also includes a link to the third-party providers' privacy policies used by the app, which is helpful to the users to understand how their data is shared with these parties.
