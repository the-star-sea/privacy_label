The original privacy label is more comprehensive as it provides more detailed information about the data that is collected and its purpose. It also includes information about security practices and a link to the privacy policy. The generated privacy label is limited in scope and does not provide as much information. Therefore, the original privacy label is better logically as it provides more transparency and better informed consent for users. Additionally, the privacy policy provided is lengthy and covers all important aspects related to user data, providing necessary details about data collection, processing, and disclosure practices.
