The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label. The generated privacy label provides detailed information about the specific data collected from the users, such as User Data for advertising communication purposes and Hosting and backend infrastructure data. It also explains the purpose of the data collection, which is helpful for users who want more transparency in how their data is being used. Additionally, the generated privacy label outlines the users' rights regarding their personal data, such as the right to withdraw consent, request information about their personal data, and request the deletion of their personal data. This information helps users make informed decisions about whether to use the application and how their personal data is being used.
