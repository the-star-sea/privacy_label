The generated privacy label seems to be more detailed and comprehensive than the original one. It includes additional information about the technical information collected, chat history, and messaging features. The security practices are also expanded to include more details about limited data access and retention, data update mechanisms, and the use of third-party service providers. Additionally, the privacy policy provides more information about the collection and use of personal information and the security practices. Therefore, logically, the generated privacy label is better as it provides more transparency and clarity about the data collection, processing, and security practices.
