The original privacy label is better logically as it provides more comprehensive information about the data that the app collects. It breaks down the data collection by type, purpose, and whether it is optional or required. It also includes security practices and a link to the privacy policy for more details. The generated privacy label is less specific and only provides general categories of data collection without outlining the specific types of data collected or the purposes for which the data is used. Additionally, the original privacy label provides information about encryption and a way to request data deletion, which the generated label does not. Finally, the privacy policy contains important information about data collection and usage that is not covered by the generated label.
