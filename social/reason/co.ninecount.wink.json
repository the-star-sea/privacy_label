The original privacy label is better as it provides more comprehensive information about the data collected and the purposes for which it is used. It also includes information about security practices and a link to the privacy policy which provides further details about data handling practices. The generated privacy label is limited in scope and provides only basic information about the data collected without any mention of security practices or a link to a privacy policy. Overall, the original privacy label provides more transparency and accountability to the user, thereby building trust between the user and the app developer.
