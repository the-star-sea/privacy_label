The generated privacy label is better than the original one as it provides detailed information about the data that is collected and shared by the app. The original privacy label only mentions that no data is collected or shared without any specific details. Additionally, the generated privacy label mentions the purpose behind collecting each type of data, making it clear to the users why their data is being collected and how it is being used by the app. The security practices are also more comprehensive in the generated privacy label, including the security measures taken to store personal data securely. The privacy policy provided also offers a detailed explanation of how user information is collected, used, and stored by the app, which enhances transparency and builds user trust. Overall, the generated privacy label is better as it offers more information and transparency to the users.
