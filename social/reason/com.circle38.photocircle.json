The generated privacy label seems to be better than the original privacy label. The reason being the generated label is more concise and categorizes the data collected into specific types such as "Media," "Personal info," "Identity and service providers," and "Online, in-app, and cross-channel advertising." Additionally, the generated label includes practices such as "Data encryption" and "Account self-deletion," which were not mentioned in the original label. The generated label also includes more details about the advertising practices of the app, which gives users a better understanding of how their data is used for advertising purposes. Lastly, the generated privacy policy clearly lists the rights of the users, such as the right to request deletion and the right to know about the personal information collected.
