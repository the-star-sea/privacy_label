The generated privacy label is better logically as it includes more relevant and specific details about the data collected, including the purposes and types of information collected. It also includes information on how to exercise user rights and explicitly states that data is not 100% secure, which is important for transparency. However, the privacy policy attached is not very comprehensive and lacks clear sections on data retention, data sharing, and user rights. A more detailed and user-friendly privacy policy could improve the overall privacy of the service.
