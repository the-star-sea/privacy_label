The generated privacy label is better than the original one. The original privacy label only mentions security practices related to data encryption and data deletion policies. It doesn't mention what kind of data the app collects from users. In contrast, the generated privacy label provides detailed information about the personal information the app collects and why it collects it. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes security practices related to limiting access to sensitive data, using data deletion policies, and precautions with third-party services. Finally, the privacy policy statement included with the generated privacy label provides more detailed information about the app's data collection practices and how user data is handled and protected. Overall, the generated privacy label provides more transparency for users and better guides them about how their data is being collected, stored, and used.
