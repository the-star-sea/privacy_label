The generated privacy label is better than the original one because it provides more detailed information about the types of data collected, the purposes for which they are collected, and the security practices followed by the company. In the original privacy label, the shared data was limited to photos, videos, crash logs, and device or other IDs, and the security practices were limited to data encryption in transit and data storage. In contrast, the generated privacy label provides information about personal data, usage data, and the different purposes for which they are collected. It also includes information about data retention, the sharing of personal information with service providers and affiliates, and the security practices followed by the company. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes information about children's privacy and provides a link to the company's privacy policy for further information. The privacy policy itself is also detailed and provides clear information about the company's data collection and management practices, as well as user rights and legal obligations.
