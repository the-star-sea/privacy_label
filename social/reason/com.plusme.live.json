The generated privacy label is better logically as it provides a more concise and clear summary of the personal information that is collected, the reasons for collecting it, and how it is used. It also includes more specific and relevant types of personal information such as payment information, chats, and third-party data. The original privacy label is more difficult to navigate and understand with several optional purposes listed for each type of data collection. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes more comprehensive security practices, notably mentioning physical, technical, and administrative safeguards and withdrawal of consent. The privacy policy also provides more specific examples of how personal information is used and shared, making it easier for users to understand the implications of using the service.
