The generated privacy label appears to be better than the original one as it provides more specific information about the type of data collected and its purpose. Additionally, it mentions that the developer strives to protect personal information using commercially acceptable means, although it cannot guarantee absolute security, which adds a layer of transparency to the privacy policy. The privacy policy itself also provides more detailed information about the information collected, including the use of third-party services that may collect information and how log data is collected. However, both privacy labels could be improved by providing more information on how users can opt-out of data collection or how to request the deletion of their data.
