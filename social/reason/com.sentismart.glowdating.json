The generated privacy label is better than the original one. The generated privacy label provides more specific and concise information on the data collected, its purpose, and type, making it easy for the users to understand. It also includes additional security practices like the use of commercially acceptable security measures and deletion of underage user data, which enhances the trustworthiness of the service. Furthermore, the generated privacy label provides information on the use of cookies, third-party service providers, and links to other sites, which are relevant concerns for users. However, the privacy policy text accompanying the generated privacy label has some errors and needs improvement, especially in terms of grammar, syntax, and clarity.
