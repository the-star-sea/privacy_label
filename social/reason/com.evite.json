The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label as it provides more specific and clear information about the data collected, the purpose for collecting it, and how it is used. It also includes information about the use of cookies, web beacons, and third-party advertising companies, which was not explicitly mentioned in the original privacy label. Additionally, the generated privacy label provides more comprehensive security practices, such as physical, electronic, and procedural measures, compared to the original privacy label that only mentions data encryption and data deletion. The privacy policy also includes information about limiting the collection of personal information and the ability to opt-out of commercial or promotional emails. Overall, the generated privacy label and privacy policy are more transparent and informative for users, which is essential for building trust and confidence in the service.
