The generated privacy label appears to be better than the original one. The original privacy label is more complex and contains a larger number of data points. On the other hand, the generated privacy label is simplified and contains only the most relevant data points that users need to be aware of. In addition, the generated privacy label contains more information about security practices and user rights, which are essential aspects of data protection. It also emphasizes the fact that users have control over their personal data and can request its deletion at any time. Therefore, the generated privacy label is more user-friendly and better in terms of privacy policy transparency and user data protection.
