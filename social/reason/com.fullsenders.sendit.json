The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label. The generated privacy label is more detailed and provides more comprehensive information about the types of personal information collected, the purposes for which that information is collected, and the security practices employed to protect that information. The generated privacy label also provides information about the use of cookies and the ability to opt-out of tracking. Additionally, the generated privacy label provides information about the right to access, correct, and delete personal information, as well as the right to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, which is important for transparency and consumer empowerment. Therefore, the generated privacy label is more user-friendly as it provides more information, is easier to understand, and is more valuable to individuals who are concerned about their privacy.
