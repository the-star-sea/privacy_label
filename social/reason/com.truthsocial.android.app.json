The generated privacy label seems to be more specific and detailed than the original privacy label. The original privacy label has a longer list of data types collected, but it is not clear how the data will be used or shared. In contrast, the generated privacy label provides more information on how the data will be used, such as for contact, technical support, and advertising purposes. It also specifies the legal basis for processing personal data under GDPR and outlines the rights of consumers under CCPA. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better as it provides more transparency and clarity around the collection and use of personal data.
