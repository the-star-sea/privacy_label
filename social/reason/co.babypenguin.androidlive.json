The generated privacy label seems to be better as it is more detailed and specific about the types of information that the app collects, why it is collected, and how it is used. It also includes information on security practices and privacy settings and options for users. Additionally, the generated label appears to be more up-to-date than the original privacy label as it includes facial tracking and mapping information which is not mentioned in the original privacy label. However, it is important to note that the privacy policy should also be read thoroughly to ensure that all aspects of the app's data collection and usage are fully understood.
