The generated privacy label seems to be better logically because it includes more detailed and relevant information about the type of data collected, the purpose for collecting it, and the security practices. The original privacy label includes fewer data types, and some of the purposes listed are vague (e.g. "App functionality"). Additionally, the generated privacy label explicitly mentions end-to-end encryption and limited data collection, which are important privacy features that users will want to know about. The privacy policy is also informative and provides clear instructions for users to control their data and exercise their rights. Overall, the generated privacy label and privacy policy provide users with more comprehensive and transparent information about how their data is handled.
