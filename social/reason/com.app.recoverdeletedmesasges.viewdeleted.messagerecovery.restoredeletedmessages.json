The generated privacy label seems better than the original one as it provides more details about what data is being collected and for what purposes. It clearly mentions that log data is being collected for app functionality and analytics, whereas the original label only talked about device or other IDs being shared for app functionality and advertising or marketing purposes. The security practices also seem more reasonable in the generated label as it specifies that commercially acceptable means are being used for protecting personal information. On the other hand, the original label mentions that data can't be deleted, which seems like a red flag for users who value their privacy. The privacy policy also provides a lot more information about what data is collected, how it is used, and how it is protected, which is a good sign for users who are concerned about their privacy. Overall, the generated privacy label provides more transparency and clarity about what users can expect in terms of data collection and protection.
