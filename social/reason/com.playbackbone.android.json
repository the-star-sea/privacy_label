The generated privacy label seems to be incomplete and lacks clarity as compared to the original privacy label. The original privacy label is more specific and detailed in terms of the types of data collected, purposes for which it's being collected and shared, and the security measures being taken to protect the data. Additionally, the original privacy label mentions the privacy policy URL, which is missing in the generated privacy label. Therefore, logically, the original privacy label is better in terms of transparency and informing users about their data privacy.
