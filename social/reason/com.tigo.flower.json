The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label as it provides more specific information about the data that is collected, its purpose, and the type of data that is shared. It also provides more details about the security practices, such as secure international transfers and verification for requests, which helps users to understand how their data is being protected. The original privacy label only mentions that data is not encrypted and provides a way to request data deletion, which is not enough information for users to make informed decisions about their privacy. Additionally, the privacy policy includes important details about the collection, use, sharing, and storage of personal information, as well as users' choices and rights regarding their data. Overall, the generated privacy label and privacy policy are more comprehensive and provide users with the necessary information to make informed decisions about their privacy.
