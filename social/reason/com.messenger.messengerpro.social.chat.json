The generated privacy label is better logically as it provides more specific and concise information about the data collected and its purpose. It also includes additional security practices, such as secure data storage and transparent data usage policies. The original privacy label is less clear and more verbose, with some data being repeated unnecessarily and with less specific information about the collected data and its purpose. The generated privacy label better aligns with the goal of providing clear and concise information to users about the data being collected and its purpose, which is essential in helping users make informed decisions about their privacy.
