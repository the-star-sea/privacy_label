The generated privacy label appears to be better logically as it provides more comprehensive information about the data that is collected, how it is used, and with whom it may be shared. The original privacy label only listed one type of data that was collected and its purpose, while the generated privacy label provides information about multiple types of data, their purposes, and whether they are optional or mandatory to provide. Additionally, the generated privacy label denotes the type of data collected, such as personal information or user content. Therefore, it can help users better understand the scope and impact of the data collection. Moreover, the generated privacy label is more transparent about sharing user information with affiliates and service providers. It also contains information about opt-out options for promotional communication. Finally, the generated privacy label provides information on the rights of the user under GDPR, such as the right to data portability. Therefore, the generated privacy label is more detailed, transparent, and user-friendly, making it better than the original privacy label.
