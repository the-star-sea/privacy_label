The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label as it provides more comprehensive information about the types of data collected. The generated privacy label includes information about both Usage Data and Personal Data, whereas the original privacy label only includes information about Device or other IDs. Additionally, the generated privacy label provides more detailed information about the security practices and retention of Personal Data. The privacy policy provided is also helpful in providing additional information about the collection and use of Personal Data. Therefore, the generated privacy label is more beneficial for users to understand the privacy policies and data collection practices of the service.
