The generated privacy label is better than the original as it provides clearer and more concise information. It also includes information on payment card details and the use of cookies and tracking technology. The original privacy label contains redundant entries and does not provide enough detail about security practices. Additionally, the privacy policy contains more comprehensive information about how data is used, collected, and disclosed, and explicitly mentions compliance with legal requirements.
