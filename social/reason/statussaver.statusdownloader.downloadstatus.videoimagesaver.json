The generated privacy label appears to be better than the original privacy label, as it provides more specific information about the data collected by the app and for what purposes they are used. The generated privacy label lists "Log Data" and "Personal Information" separately, along with their respective purposes, whereas the original privacy label only lists "Crash logs" and "Diagnostics" as shared data for Analytics and App info and performance purposes. The generated privacy label also includes a practice of "Commercially acceptable methods of protection" for data security purposes, which is more informative than the original privacy label's two security practices. However, it is important to note that the privacy policy itself is not very comprehensive and could benefit from more detailed information on how user data is collected, used, and shared.
