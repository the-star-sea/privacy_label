The generated privacy label seems to be less detailed and comprehensive than the original privacy label. The original privacy label has specified the different types of data that are collected, the purposes for which they are collected, and whether they are optional or not. It has also included information about security practices and a link to the privacy policy. The generated privacy label, on the other hand, has only mentioned a few types of data that are collected and the purposes for which they are collected. It has also included information about security practices but has not provided a link to the privacy policy. 

Therefore, logically, the original privacy label is better as it provides more detailed and comprehensive information about the data collection and usage practices of the company. Users can make more informed decisions about whether or not they want to use the app based on this information.
