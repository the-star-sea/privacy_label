The generated privacy label seems better logically as it provides more relevant information about the type of data that is collected, for what purpose it is collected, and whether it is optional or not. It also mentions the security practices adopted by the company to protect data, and explicitly states that the services are not directed at children under 13 years of age. On the other hand, the original privacy label only mentions the data that is shared and collected by the app, and the security practices adopted by the developer. It also does not provide information about cookies or age restrictions applicable to the use of services. Therefore, the generated privacy label appears to be more informative and comprehensive compared to the original privacy label.
