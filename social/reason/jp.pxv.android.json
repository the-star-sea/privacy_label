The generated privacy label appears to be better than the original privacy label, as it provides more detailed information about the data that is being collected and shared. The original privacy label includes general categories such as "purchase history" and "other app performance data," while the generated privacy label breaks down the specific types of data being collected and shared, such as "financial info" and "web browsing." The generated privacy label also includes additional information about whether data can be deleted and includes links to specific privacy policies for each entity that collects data. Overall, the generated privacy label provides clearer, more specific information for users to understand how their data is being used and shared.
