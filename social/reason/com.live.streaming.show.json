The generated privacy label is better than the original one because it provides more clear and detailed information about the data the app collects, shares, and how it is used. The original privacy label only listed two security practices and did not provide any information about the collected or shared data. However, the generated privacy label lists specific data such as device or other IDs and personal information like name, email address, age, and gender, and also mentions the purposes for which the data will be used, whether it is necessary or optional, and for third party data processing. It also mentions that personal data may be shared with third parties, but adequate protection measures will be taken to ensure data privacy laws and policies are complied with. Additionally, it specifies that browsing and interaction information on third-party websites is collected. The privacy policy also clearly states the main purposes for data processing and provides information on how to contact the app developer. Overall, the generated privacy label provides a comprehensive overview of the app's data practices and privacy policy, making it better for users to understand and make informed decisions about their privacy.
