The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label. The original privacy label is incomplete, as it only covers the types of data that are collected and the security practices in place. On the other hand, the generated privacy label provides more detailed information on the specific data that is shared and collected, as well as the purposes for which it is used. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes information on user data protection rights and how users can control their data. It also provides information on specific features like end-to-end encryption and account self-destruction. Overall, the generated privacy label provides more comprehensive and useful information for users.
