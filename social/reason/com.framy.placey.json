The generated privacy label seems to be more comprehensive and specific compared to the original one. It provides detailed information on the types of data collected, the purposes for which they are collected, and whether they are optional or mandatory. Additionally, it outlines the security practices used by the service. However, the original privacy label, while less detailed, does provide more information on the types of shared data, such as approximate location or crash logs. 

Overall, it is better to have a more comprehensive and specific privacy label for better transparency and clarity on data collection, usage and protection. The generated privacy label seems to be more effective at accomplishing this.
