The generated privacy label seems to have a more simplified and concise format compared to the original privacy label. However, the original privacy label provides more detailed information about the types and purposes of data collected, including optional data that users may choose to provide or not. It also includes information about the security practices and a link to the privacy policy. Therefore, the original privacy label appears to be better logically as it provides more comprehensive information to users. The generated privacy label may be a useful summary of the most important information, but it should not replace the detailed and specific information provided in the original privacy label.
