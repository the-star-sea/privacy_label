The generated privacy label is logically better than the original privacy label. 

The original privacy label provides limited information on the collected and shared data, including only six data types. It also includes vague security practices which do not indicate how collected data is protected. 

In contrast, the generated privacy label includes more comprehensive information on the collected and shared data, listing all the purposes and data types in detail. The security practices are described in a more meaningful and informative way, providing details on how data is encrypted and how multi-factor authentication is used to protect the user's data and account. Moreover, the privacy policy itself is more comprehensive as it describes the user's privacy rights and responsibilities, how the collected data is shared, and how to opt-out of targeted ads. 

Therefore, the generated privacy label is a better choice as it provides users with a more comprehensive understanding of how their data is collected, shared, and protected and enables them to make informed decisions about using the website and its services.
