The generated privacy label is better logically as it provides more specific details about the data collected by the app and the security measures in place to protect that data. The original privacy label is less informative and only provides general information about encryption and data deletion. The generated privacy label provides more insights into the types of data collected by the app, such as location, camera, and calendar events, and for what purposes. Additionally, the generated privacy label also mentions compliance with GDPR, which is important for users in the European Union. In summary, the generated privacy label has more detailed and specific information, making it more beneficial for users to make informed decisions about their privacy.
