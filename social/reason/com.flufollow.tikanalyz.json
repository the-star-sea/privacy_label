The generated privacy label seems to be better than the original one as it provides more details about the data being collected. The original label only mentions the types of data being collected, whereas the generated label includes specific details about the purpose for collecting that data, whether it is optional or not, and the type of data being shared. Additionally, the generated label provides information on security practices such as the use of commercially acceptable means of protecting personal information, no collection of personally identifiable information from children under 13, and advising users to review the privacy policy of third-party service providers. The original label only mentions two security practices but does not provide much detail about them. Thus, the generated privacy label seems to be more comprehensive and helpful for users to understand how their data is being collected and used.
