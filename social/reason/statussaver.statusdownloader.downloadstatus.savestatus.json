The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label because it provides more detailed and specific information about the data being collected and shared. The original privacy label only listed general categories of data without specifying what exactly is being collected and for what purpose, while the generated privacy label provides more specific information about the collected data, what it is being used for, and the security practices in place to protect it. Additionally, the generated privacy label mentions third-party services used by the app and provides a link to their privacy policies, which is important information for users. However, both labels could be improved by providing a more user-friendly and readable format for presenting the information.
