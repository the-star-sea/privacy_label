The generated privacy label is better than the original, as it is more concise and easier to read for users who may not be familiar with technical jargon. The original privacy label has more detailed information but may be overwhelming for some users. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes a clear section on cookies, which is often overlooked in privacy policies but is important for users to understand. However, both privacy labels could benefit from including more information about how long data is stored and how it is protected from unauthorized access.
