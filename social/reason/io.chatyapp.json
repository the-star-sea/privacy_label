The generated privacy label seems better than the original one. The generated label is more specific about the actual data collected, while the original one is more general. The generated label also includes information about how the data is processed and shared, along with the security practices employed to protect the data. The original label missed some important aspects like behavioral data, general demographics, and information collected from other devices used by the user. Additionally, the generated privacy label clearly states the rights of the user regarding their information, whereas the original one did not mention them explicitly. Overall, the generated privacy label appears to offer more transparency and information than the original one.
