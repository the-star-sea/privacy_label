The generated privacy label seems to provide more concise and specific information about the data collected and how it will be used. It also includes additional security practices and information about third-party service providers for analytics. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better logically as it provides more details about data collection and usage, which helps users to make informed decisions about their privacy. However, it should be noted that a privacy policy that provides easy-to-understand language should be used in conjunction with the privacy label to ensure that users fully understand the data collected and used by the app.
