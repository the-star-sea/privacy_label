The generated privacy label is better than the original one as it provides clear and concise information about what data the app collects, for what purpose, and who it is shared with. The generated privacy label also includes the security practices of the app, which is helpful for users to know how their data is protected. The original privacy label, on the other hand, seems to be too detailed and overwhelming, making it difficult for users to understand the information at a glance. Additionally, the privacy policy of ChatJoin provided in the original label is not written in a straightforward manner, making it challenging for users to understand their rights and obligations. Therefore, the generated privacy label provides a better user experience and ensures transparency and clarity.
