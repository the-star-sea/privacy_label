The generated privacy label appears to provide less detailed information compared to the original privacy label. For example, the original privacy label mentions specific types of data collected (such as "Purchase history" and "Other user-generated content") as well as the purpose of collecting such data. The generated privacy label, on the other hand, uses more general language (such as "User-generated content (photos, comments, etc.)") and does not provide as much information on the purpose of collecting such data.

Therefore, logically speaking, the original privacy label is better as it provides more comprehensive and specific information to the user about the data that is collected and for what purposes it is being collected.
