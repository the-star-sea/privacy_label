The generated privacy label is better logically as it provides more detailed information about the collected and shared data, as well as the security practices implemented by the application. It also includes information on how users can opt-out of interest-based advertising and how they can request to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information. The original privacy label is less comprehensive and does not provide as much information about the collected and shared data or the security practices implemented by the application. Additionally, the privacy policy provided is helpful but not directly comparable to the privacy labels, as it covers different aspects of the application's data processing and privacy practices.
