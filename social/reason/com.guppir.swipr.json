When comparing the original privacy label and the generated privacy label, it is evident that the generated privacy label is better logically. The original privacy label is confusing and overwhelming, with no clear categorization of the data and its purposes. The generated privacy label is more concise and straightforward in explaining the data collected, its purpose, and optional choices. The generated privacy label also includes more security practices and details on how the user can control their data. The privacy policy provided by the company is lacking detail and organization, making it difficult for users to understand their rights and how their information may be used. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better as it clearly outlines what data is collected, how it is used, and includes more secure practices for users.
