The generated privacy label is better because it provides more comprehensive information about the types of data collected, the purposes for which the data is collected, and how the data is being processed and safeguarded. The original privacy label only includes one type of shared data, whereas the generated one includes multiple types of shared and collected data. Moreover, the generated privacy label mentions the use of cookies and similar technologies, which is an important aspect of data collection and processing that is not included in the original privacy label. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes more detailed information about the security practices that are implemented to protect users' data. Finally, the privacy policy text provides additional information that is not included in the privacy label, such as how users can adjust their privacy settings and how they can delete their account.
