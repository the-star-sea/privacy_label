The generated privacy label is better than the original one because it provides more detailed and specific information about the data that is collected, the purpose of collecting it, and the types of information that are considered personal. It also includes additional security practices that are aimed at protecting the user's data and notifies them in case of a data breach. The original privacy label, on the other hand, provides limited information about the data collected and does not include specific security practices. The generated privacy label is more transparent and user-friendly, which helps users make informed decisions about using the app.
