It also includes security practices and emphasizes the user's control over their data usage through settings. The original privacy label is less clear and doesn't provide as much specific information about different types of data being collected. However, it does include some security practices as well as a link to the privacy policy. Overall, the generated privacy label is clearer and more comprehensive.
