The generated privacy label seems to be more concise and straightforward compared to the original privacy label. The generated label is easier to read and understand, as it presents information more clearly. The original label contains more detailed information, but it may be overwhelming for users. Additionally, the generated privacy label also includes information on how personal data is encrypted and complies with applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, the generated privacy label appears to be better than the original privacy label.
