The generated privacy label seems to be worse than the original privacy label as it collects and shares much more personal information. The original privacy label has a clear explanation of what data is being collected, why it is being collected, and how it is being used. It also provides security practices explicitly, such as data encryption and the ability to delete collected data. In contrast, the generated privacy label provides vague information about data protection and collection and shares more sensitive information, such as payment and Facebook account information. Additionally, the generated privacy label does not provide a clear privacy policy and uses broad terms such as "protection of information." Therefore, the original privacy label is better than the generated privacy label logically.
