The generated privacy label is better because it provides more detailed and specific information about the data collected, purpose, type, and security practices of the app. It also includes information about how long the data will be retained and how users can access and update their personal information. The original privacy label only has general information about the collected data and security practices, and it does not provide details about how long the data will be retained. The generated privacy label also includes information about the platform's compliance with applicable laws and regulations in processing personal data, which is important for building trust with users. Additionally, the privacy policy provides even more detailed information about the data collection and sharing practices, as well as user rights and information related to children's privacy.
