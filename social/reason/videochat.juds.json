The generated privacy label is better because it provides more specific and clear information about the types of data being collected, the purposes for which they are being collected, and the security practices in place to protect the data. The original privacy label is more general and does not provide as much detail. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes information about data deletion processes and protection against hacking, which are important for users to know. The privacy policy also provides clear and concise language about data collection practices and user rights, which is important for transparency and building trust with users.
