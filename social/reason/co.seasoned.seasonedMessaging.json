The generated privacy label seems to be better than the original privacy label as it is more concise and clearer. It includes fewer categories, making it easier for users to understand what data is being collected and for what purpose. The language used in the generated label is also simpler and more easily understandable than the original. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes specific security practices that the company follows, which gives users more assurance of their data's security. The original privacy policy could benefit from a similar section highlighting the security measures that the company has taken to protect users' data.
