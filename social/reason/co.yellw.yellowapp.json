The generated privacy label seems more well-organized, concise, and user-friendly than the original privacy label. It provides clear categories of shared data and collected data, and also includes additional security practices. The explanations are also more detailed and informative, making it easier for users to understand how their personal data is being used. The privacy policy also seems thorough and transparent, providing useful information and incorporating legal requirements. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better logically.
