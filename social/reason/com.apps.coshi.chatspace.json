The generated privacy label seems to be incomplete and irrelevant to the original privacy label and privacy policy provided. The original privacy label provides a detailed list of the data that the app collects and the purpose behind collecting each data point. It also mentions the security practices followed by the app to protect users' data. The privacy policy provided gives a clear explanation of how user data is collected, processed, and used, along with the users' rights and how to exercise them. 

On the other hand, the generated privacy label only mentions two types of data - IP address and cookie data, with vague and repetitive purposes. It also provides a list of security practices that seem irrelevant to the context of the privacy policy provided.

Therefore, logically speaking, the original privacy label and privacy policy are better than the generated privacy label as they provide comprehensive and relevant information about the app's data collection and processing practices and the users' rights and how to exercise them.
