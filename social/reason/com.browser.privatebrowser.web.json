The generated privacy label is better than the original one. The original privacy label provides only general information about security practices and does not mention any specific type of data collected from the user. On the other hand, the generated privacy label provides detailed information about the type of data collected, the purpose of collecting it, and whether it is optional or mandatory to provide such data. It also highlights the security practices put in place to protect the data. Additionally, the original privacy policy has a link to a third-party website for users to read the privacy policy, which may not be trusted by users. The generated privacy policy includes the complete text of the privacy policy for the service, which is more transparent. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better as it provides more detailed and transparent information to the users.
