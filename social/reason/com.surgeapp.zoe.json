The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label because it is more concise and straightforward. It only includes the four data categories that the app collects and explains why they are collected. Additionally, it includes three security practices that the app employs to protect the user's data. Moreover, the privacy policy is clear, explaining how the user's data is collected, used, and shared with third parties. It also outlines the user's rights regarding their data. Finally, the privacy policy specifies how long the app will store the user's data and the conditions for deleting it. Overall, the generated privacy label and policy are more user-friendly and easy to understand.
