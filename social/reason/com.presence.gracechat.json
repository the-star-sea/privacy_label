The generated privacy label is better logically as it provides more details and accurately describes the data collected and the purposes for which it is used, including information about the TrueDepth camera, storage of messages, and location information. It also includes information about security practices such as automatically deleting messages and disclosing legal requirements for storing data. The original privacy label, while providing some information about the data collected and purpose, is less comprehensive and does not provide information about practices such as automatic deletion of messages. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes information about cookies, which the original label did not cover. Finally, the privacy policy provided at the end of the generated privacy label provides additional information about the collection and use of data, as well as details on how users can modify their settings and request account deletion.
