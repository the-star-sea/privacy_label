The original privacy label provides more details about the specific types of data that may be shared or collected by the app and their purposes, whereas the generated privacy label only lists general categories of data and their purposes. Therefore, the original privacy label is better as it gives users a more specific and comprehensive understanding of the data privacy practices of the app. In addition, the privacy policy provided by the app provides more information on how data is used and shared, and the legal basis for collecting and processing data. Overall, it is important for users to have access to clear and detailed privacy labels and policies to make informed decisions about using an app and sharing their personal information.
