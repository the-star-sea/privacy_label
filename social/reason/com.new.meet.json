The generated privacy label is better than the original one because it provides more detailed and specific information about the data that is collected and shared by the app. The original label does not provide any information about the types of data that are collected, while the generated label specifies the type of information collected, whether it is optional, the purpose for which it is collected, and the category of data it falls under. This makes it easier for users to make informed decisions about whether or not to use the app and to manage their privacy settings. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes a more detailed description of the security practices and data deletion policy of the app, which is important for users concerned about their data privacy and security. Finally, the privacy policy provided by the app is also important for users, as it specifies the conditions and limits under which the app collects and shares user data, and gives them the ability to control their data and delete their account if they wish to do so.
