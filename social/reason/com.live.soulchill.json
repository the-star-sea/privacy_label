The generated privacy label seems to be more concise and easy to understand compared to the original privacy label. It provides clear and specific information about the data that is collected, its purpose, and whether it is optional or mandatory to share. The security practices listed suggest that the developer is taking necessary precautions to protect the user's data. However, since the generated privacy label is shorter, it lacks some information that the original privacy label had, such as the privacy policy URL. The privacy policy, which is always necessary, is appropriately included in the original privacy label but is missing in the generated privacy label. Therefore, the original privacy label is better as it contains all the necessary information as well as the privacy policy URL.
