The generated privacy label is better logically because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed list of the types of data that the app collects, including personal information and financial information. Additionally, it clearly outlines the purposes for which each type of data is collected, such as app functionality, payment processing, and analytics. The original privacy label only listed one type of collected data, and it was not clear what purpose it served. The generated privacy label also includes information on how data is collected, such as through cookies and similar technologies, and how it is shared with third parties. The security practices are similar in both labels. However, the generated label includes information on how long data is stored, how data is processed, and how users can delete their accounts and personal information. Overall, the generated privacy label is more detailed, more informative, and more transparent than the original privacy label.
