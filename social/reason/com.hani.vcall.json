The generated privacy label is better than the original one as it provides more specifics about what data is collected, for what purposes, and how it is protected. The original label lists the same purposes for almost all the data collected, making it difficult for a user to understand which data is actually necessary for a particular purpose. The generated label categorizes the shared and collected data into more specific types such as geolocation, device information, usage information, and contact information, making it easier to understand what data is being shared and collected. The generated privacy label also includes information about cookies and similar technologies, which is missing from the original label. Additionally, the generated label provides more detailed information on security practices, like data encryption and suspension of use in case of a security breach. Overall, the generated privacy label provides more clear and transparent information on data collection, sharing, and protection, which is beneficial for users to make informed decisions about using the app.
