The generated privacy label seems to provide more specific information about the data that is collected, its purpose, and whether it is optional or not. It also includes more security practices and specifies the data retention periods. However, the original privacy label provides a clearer and more concise overview of the data and security practices. 

Logically, the generated privacy label is better as it provides a more detailed understanding of the data collected and how it is used. This can help users make more informed decisions about whether they want to use the app and can also help build trust between the user and the app. Additionally, the more specific information can help users understand how their data is being used for advertising and personalization. On the other hand, the original privacy label is too brief and generic and may not provide as much clarity and transparency to the user.
