The generated privacy label is better than the original one as it provides more specific information about the data collection, its purposes, and whether or not it is optional. The generated privacy label also includes more security practices that are in place to protect the user's data. Additionally, the privacy policy is more detailed and transparent, clearly stating the purpose of data processing and the practices that are in place to ensure the safety of the user's data. The original privacy label lacks specific information about the data that is collected and its purposes, and also does not provide enough detail about the security practices that are in place to protect the user's data.
