The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label as it provides a detailed list of the collected data, including the type, purpose, and whether it is optional or not. It also includes security practices that the company follows, which gives users a better understanding of how their data is being protected. Moreover, the privacy policy of the website also explains in detail how the collected data is being used and processed, as well as providing information on user rights and how to contact the company for exercising them. Overall, the generated privacy label and the privacy policy are more transparent and user-friendly, which can enable users to make informed decisions about using the service.
