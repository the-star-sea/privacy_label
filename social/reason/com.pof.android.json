The generated privacy label seems to be better than the original one as it provides clearer and more specific information about the types of data collected, the purposes of data usage, and the security practices implemented by the app. It also includes a section about the retention and deletion of data, which is not present in the original label. The original label is quite vague and uses broad categories like "Other info" and "App interactions", which may not provide a clear understanding of what data is being collected and for what purposes. Additionally, the generated label includes a mention of the app's Selfie Verification feature and the collection of biometric data, which is not present in the original label. This information could be critical for users who value their privacy and want to make informed decisions about using the app.
