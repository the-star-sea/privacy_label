The generated privacy label seems to provide more detailed and specific information about the data collected and its usage. The original privacy label is more generalized and lacks information about certain important aspects such as cookies and other technologies used, user control over their information, and access restriction to user information. Therefore, the generated privacy label appears to be better logically as it covers more relevant details that users might want to know before using the app and ensures more transparency. However, it is essential to note that the privacy policy text provided by PickU sounds vague and confusing at some points, which could make it difficult for users to understand their privacy rights and the app's data collection practices.
