The generated privacy label seems to be more detailed and comprehensive as compared to the original privacy label. The generated privacy label includes specific data types that are collected and their purposes, whereas the original label is more general and does not mention the types of data collected, making it difficult for users to understand the potential risks. Additionally, the generated privacy label mentions the security practices that the company follows, like data protection and regularly updating the privacy policy, which provides assurance to users. The original privacy label, on the other hand, only mentions the security practices in brief without providing any specific details. Hence, the generated privacy label is better as it provides more specific information and helps users make informed decisions about using the application.
