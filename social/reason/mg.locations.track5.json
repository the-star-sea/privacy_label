The generated privacy label is better because it clearly identifies the specific data being collected, its purpose, and whether it is optional or not. It also includes information on user control over location and contact data sharing and the ability to request account or personal information deletion. In addition, the privacy policy clearly explains how information is collected and used in detail. However, the original privacy label is more focused on app performance data and device or other IDs, which may not be as important to users. The generated label is more user-centered and transparent, which is crucial for building trust with users.
