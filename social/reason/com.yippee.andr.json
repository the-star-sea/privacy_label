The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label. The original privacy label provides vague information about the data collection and sharing practices of the app, whereas the generated privacy label is more detailed and includes information about the specific types of data collected, the purposes for which the data is collected, and whether the collection of the data is optional or mandatory. The generated privacy label also includes more comprehensive security practices and details about the app's data deletion and breach reporting policies. Additionally, the privacy policy that accompanies the generated privacy label provides more detailed information about the app's data collection and sharing practices, as well as information about how to request the deletion of personal information and close an account. Overall, the generated privacy label provides users with more transparency and control over their personal information, making it the better option.
