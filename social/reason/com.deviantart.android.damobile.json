The generated privacy label is better logically as it provides more specific and actionable information regarding the data that is collected, its purpose and the security practices in place to protect it. It also includes information about the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, and how to manage them. Additionally, it provides information for California residents about their rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The original privacy label is less detailed and specific, and does not provide as much information about the data collected, its purpose, or how it is protected.
