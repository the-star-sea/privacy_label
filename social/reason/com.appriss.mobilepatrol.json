The generated privacy label is better than the original one logically. The generated privacy label provides more specific and detailed information about the data collected, the purpose of collecting data, and the third parties with whom the data may be shared. It also includes information about the use of cookies, web beacons, and website log files, as well as the inability to honor web browser Do Not Track signals.  However, the original privacy label only tells that data is encrypted in transit and provides a link to their privacy policy without any information on what data they collect and share. The privacy policy of the company does discuss the data that may be collected, but the generated privacy label gives a quick summary of the most important information the user may want to know, making it easier for users to understand what kind of data the website may collect and how it will be used.
