The generated privacy label is better logically because it provides more specific information about what type of data is collected, the purpose of collecting it, and the optional/mandatory nature of such collection. It also provides additional security practices, including a way to request data deletion and a disclaimer about not responding to "Do Not Track" signals. The original privacy label is too generic, with no clear indication of what data is collected, shared, and for what purposes. It also includes a negative security practice without any resolution, which could deter potential users. Additionally, the privacy policy contains conflicting information that could lead to confusion, such as stating that the app collects phonebook information but also claiming that users have total control over their profile information. The generated privacy label provides a better understanding of the app's data handling practices, which is crucial for user transparency and trust.
