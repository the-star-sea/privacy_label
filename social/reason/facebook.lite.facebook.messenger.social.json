The generated privacy label is better logically as it is more specific and transparent than the original privacy label. The original privacy label has a list of shared data that is quite broad and vague, which makes it difficult for users to understand what data is collected and for what purpose. The generated privacy label, on the other hand, lists a specific type of data that is collected and for what purpose it is used. Additionally, the generated privacy label provides more information on security practices, which is helpful for users to determine whether their personal data is adequately protected. Overall, the generated privacy label is clearer, more precise, and more informative.
