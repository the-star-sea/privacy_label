How GoFundMe Works
What is crowdfunding? The Platform provides information about GoFundMe, and explains how users can post a fundraiser, accept monetary donations, and details our related services (together with the Platform, the Services) to users and visitors (you or your). Please view our California Privacy Notice to learn more. Our payment processors collect your bank details as well as other information necessary to set up the withdrawals. For example, we may offer an interactive chat feature on the Platform for customer service purposes. We would ask that you take care not to send financial information or other sensitive personal data to us through our chat services or other means, unless we ask you specifically for that data as part of providing our Service to you. We collect the information listed in this section for the purposes described below in the sections Our Use of Information Collected and Our Disclosure of Information Collected Through the Services. If you decide to do that, we give you the option to either add information to our Platform or to provide us access to information stored in your email and mobile devices address books, such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers of your contacts (collectively, Third-Party Data). Your biometric information will be used for identity verification and fraud prevention purposes and in accordance with this Notice. If you would like to opt out of these efforts (excluding the verification and fraud prevention purposes), please contact us at the email address or mailing address set forth under Contacting GoFundMe. This information is collected passively by using various technologies, and includes the type of geolocation information, Internet browser or mobile device you use, any website from which you have come to the Services, your operating system, and location data through an IP address that identifies the city and state where you logged into the Platform or your precise geo-location if you have permitted your mobile device to provide that information to us. When you visit our Platform, our web server, business providers, and/or the Social Networking Services (defined below) are integrated into the Service, we use cookies or other electronic technologies (such as web beacons or pixel tags) for various purposes. Unlike cookies, web beacons are not placed on your computers. Some of the Non-Essential Cookies used are set by us to collect and process certain data on our behalf and some are set by third parties and/or our Social Networking Services. As part of such integration, the Social Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the Social Networking Service (for example, your name and photograph, as well as other information that you permit the Social Networking Service to share with us). You can also learn more about Cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org, which includes additional useful information on Cookies and how to block Cookies using different types of browsers or mobile devices. If you are located in Europe, we process this information as necessary (i) to fulfill our obligations under our contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, or (ii) for our legitimate interest, such as, to maintain our relationship with you or to protect you and us against fraud. C. Agents, Consultants, Vendors and Related Third Parties:
GoFundMe contracts with other companies to perform certain business-related functions on GoFundMes behalf, and we provide access to or disclose your information with these companies so they can perform services for us. D. Unaffiliated Parties that Partner With Us or our Affiliate or Other Services You Choose to Link:
GoFundMe discloses personal information with third parties that partner with us on various initiatives and/or that offer services you choose to link to your GoFundMe fundraiser or that are linked to a GoFundMe fundraiser to which you may donate. For example, if you donate to a fundraiser, we disclose your name, email address and donation information you have provided in connection with your donation with the organizer or beneficiary, who may contact you. G. Your Consent
In certain situations, we may disclose your information in the event that you consent to the disclosure of your information. J. Other Users of Our Services
We provide your information to other users of our Services if you choose to make your information publicly available in a publicly accessible area of the Services, such as in your fundraiser or in the comments. If you are under the age of 13 (or 16 for children located in Europe), please do not use the Services and/or submit any information through the Services. The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third-Party Sites. We do not respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. When we no longer need to retain your information, we will take reasonable steps to remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it in accordance with our internal document retention policies. By using the Platform, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Notice. The above rights may be limited under applicable law. We will notify you of any material updates or changes we make to this Notice.
