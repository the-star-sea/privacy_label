We recommend that you read this Privacy Notice in full to ensure you are fully informed. Why do we collect your personal information? How long do we retain your personal information? How do we secure your personal information? What are your rights in relation to personal information? The pages that Linktree Users are able to create using the Linktree Services are referred to in this Privacy Notice as User Profiles. We are headquartered in Melbourne, Australia and have offices in Sydney. This Privacy Notice does not address Processor Services. To opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. We use this information for our internal analytics purposes, to improve the quality and relevance of our Platform and Linktree Services, to provide hints and tips to our Linktree Users and to make recommendations of Linktree Profiles you might be interested in viewing. Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading How do we use cookies and similar tracking technology below. In general, we will use the information we collect for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice or for purposes that we explain to you at the time we collect your personal information. To ensure the Linktree Services are relevant to you and your device, to notify you about changes to the Linktree Services, and to deliver targeted and/or localised content based on your user data, location and preferences. To conduct business planning, reporting, and forecasting. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:
to our group companies, third party services providers (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Platform or Linktree Services), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information. We will not store or collect your payment card details. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by payment card industry data security standards (PCI-DSS) as managed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). You can exercise this right by clicking on the unsubscribe or opt-out link in the marketing e-mails we send you or completing our Data Request Form. Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the US and Canada) are available here and the UK here.) Complaints
We take your privacy concerns seriously. If an investigation has been opened following a complaint made by you, then we will contact you with the result as soon as possible. In the unlikely circumstances we are unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction, you may contact the local privacy and data protection authorities in your jurisdiction. Changes to This Privacy Notice
We may update our Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. This section applies to the personal information we collected from California residents during the 12 months prior to the effective date of this Privacy Notice, depending on interactions with us. (c) Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information
As mentioned above, we do not sell personal information and we do not believe that our sharing of information would qualify as a sale under California law. Nonetheless, if you are a California resident who has purchased products or services from us, you may submit a request to record your preference to opt out by emailing us at support@linktr.ee. Upon making a request, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, and request details. Do Not Track
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
