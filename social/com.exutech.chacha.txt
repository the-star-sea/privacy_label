Privacy Policy
HOLLA is a real-time video chat mobile application. You can meet cool and interesting people worldwide, enjoy fun chats, and make new friends on our platform.
This Privacy Policy covers what HG VISION PTE.LTD. (“HOLLA” “HOLLA App” “we” “our”) does with the Personal Information (as defined herein) that you share with us and the data we collect when you are accessing our App and/or our Service. Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business, so please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using or accessing our App or our Service, you agree to the privacy policies outlined below.
1.Coverage of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy covers HOLLA's treatment of Personal Information that we collect while you are using the App and the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that HOLLA does not own or control, including but not limited to third-party services you access through HOLLA, the App, or the Service, or to individuals that HOLLA does not employ or manage. As our Service integrates with third-party sites, such as Facebook, and other sites and social networks, we assume that you are already aware of the privacy policies of those other sites and networks when using our App and/or our Service and when you allow us to interact with these sites and networks on your behalf.
2.Information Collected
There are three basic ways we collect information:
- Information you choose to give us
- Information we get when you use our services
- Information we get from third parties
Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.
3.Information Collected with your Consent and Permission
By visiting and interacting with HOLLA, its App, and/or its Service, you provide us with Personal Information which may include, but is not limited to, the following:
- Personally Identifiable Information: may include, without limitation, the information provided when you register to use the App and/or the Service, including your name, profile picture, date of birth, phone number, phone book content, email address, gender, Facebook account info and friend list, and/or other social network usernames and ‘likes' and preferences, friend lists and a number of friends you have via social networks, messages to other users of the App and the Service, use information regarding your use of the Service, profile picture that you upload via the App or the Service, and browser information.
- The information you choose to provide above may be shared with your contacts on our service. You have total control over your profile information, and you can access to modify it at any time. In addition, if you register to our service with your Facebook account (e.g., Facebook Connect), we may store your Facebook ID and the corresponding token on our servers. If you give us your consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information you make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last names, email addresses, profile pictures, friend lists, and birthdays). Your Profile is open to other users of the Service who are connected to you on our service. In addition, unless you opt out (which you may do so at any time in the settings of our application), your Profile is discoverable by other users. You may “block” any user on our platform to prevent unwanted access to your Personal Information.
- You may also choose to share your mobile device’s Contacts list with us (including names, numbers, emails, Facebook ID, Apple ID, etc.), and we will store it on our servers to help you improve our service, e.g., connecting with friends on our service. If you do not want us to store this information, you may opt out through your account settings or notify us via email. If done so, we will not be able to offer some of the features of our service.
Of course, you’ll also provide us with whatever information you send through the services. Keep in mind that the users you send texts, images, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to HOLLA: Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.
We’ll say it anyway: When you contact HOLLA Support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.
4.Information Collected through your Usage of the Services
When you use our services, we collect information about which services you’ve used and how you’ve used them. We might know, for instance, that you used one of the filters in-app and the number of times you have used this filter. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:
Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our services. We may collect information including but not limited to the following:
- How you interact with the services, such as which filters you view or the number of times you apply to discover.
- How you communicate with other HOLLA users, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot). We allow you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos, and other forms of communication on our service with other users. If you choose to do so, your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos, and other communications may be stored on our servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos, or other communications on our service is your decision. By sharing that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available. We are not responsible for using or misusing the information you share.
- Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, none direct display of content moderation, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).
- User content may also be collected, e.g., photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials you create on the service. Other users on the service may capture your photos and videos, which can be stored and used by us or third-party services (e.g., Facebook) for content moderation and community safety monitoring. You can change third-party sharing options or write to us directly in our product settings.
- Device Phonebook. Because HOLLA is all about communicating with friends, we may—with your consent—collect information from your device’s phonebook.
- Location Information. When you use our services, we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your general location using GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.
-Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. Please check out our Cookie Statement to learn more about how we use cookies and your choices. To learn more about how third parties use these technologies on our services, read our privacy policy's Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others section.

- Details about how you’ve used our services.
- Device information, such as your web browser type and language.
- Access times.
- Pages viewed.
- IP address.
- Identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies may uniquely identify your device or browser.
- Pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.
- If you contact us by email and other means (Twitter, Facebook, etc.), we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence. We will use these contact info and correspondence if we respond to you.
5.Information We Collect from Third Parties
We may collect information other users provide about you when using our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook—and you’re one of that user’s contacts—we may combine the information we collect from that user’s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from companies owned or operated by us or any other third-party sources and combine that with the information we collect through our services.
6.How is Your Information Being Used?
What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as:
- Develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services.
- Communicate with you.
- Monitor and analyze trends and usage.
- Personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information or customizing the content we show you, including ads.
- Enhance the safety and security of our products and services.
- Verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity.
- Use the information collected from cookies and other technology to enhance the services and your experience with them.
- Enforce our Terms of Service and other usage policies.
We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as a local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.
7.How is Your Information Being Shared
In certain instances, we may share your personal information with third-party service providers to further improve and optimize our service for you. We may share information about you in the following ways:
- With other users. We may share the following information with other users
- Information about you, such as your username and name;
- Information about how you have interacted with the services, such as the names of users you are friends with and other information that will help users understand your connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you know, we may share whether you and the requestor have HOLLA friends in common;
- Any additional information you have consented for us to share. For example, when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook;
- With all users and the general public. We may share the following information with all users as well as the general public:
- Public information like your profile pictures that you submit to Local. If a Local service is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, it may be viewed by the public.
- With our affiliates, we may share information with entities within the HOLLA family of companies.
- With third parties we may share your information with the following third parties:
- With service providers, sellers, and business advisors. We may share information about you with service providers who provide services and functionality on our behalf, sellers that provide goods through our services, business advisors that our lawyers, accountants, business consultants, insurers, and auditors, to the extent it is necessary for them to provide us with their services.
- With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
- Comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation;
- Investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations;
- Protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.
- With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition. If HOLLA gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.
- In the aggregate or after de-identification. We may also share with third parties, such as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
You expressly agree that the information provided when you register the App and/or the content you created when using the App (including, without limitation, photos, text, messages, posts, HTML, URLs, pictures, video, and other content), may be recorded, stored, published and made available to the rest of HOLLA users. Furthermore, other users may follow you on the App, and your followers can see, for example, the user-contributed content you uploaded to the App. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and your knowledge. We, therefore, urge you to consider carefully including any specific information you may deem private in the information you provide or the content you create in the App.
Your information may also be stored and processed in any country we provide service to due to server facilities and third-party service teams. By using our service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your country.
If you do not agree with all of the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our service. Community safety is our number one priority, and some of the above user information is mandatory to create a safe community for all users.
8.Information Shared with Third Parties with Your Consent and Permission
The services may also contain third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations, or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service that’s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. To the extent that you use a profile that may be available to others on our Service, you are solely responsible for its content and accuracy at all times. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.
9.How Long Do We Keep Your Content
Finally—and this is important—you should understand that users who see the content you provide can always save it using screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other image-capture technology. It’s also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be able to access messages forensically or find them in a device’s temporary storage. If user information is deleted from our App, we cannot promise deletion will occur within a specific timeframe. And we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period or as required by law.
10.Protection of Your Information
Protecting user privacy and personal information is a top priority for us. We process your personal information to improve and enforce our security measures, combat spam, malware, malicious activities, or security risks, and monitor and verify your identity so unauthorized users do not access your account with us. Access to any user information is restricted to our employees, contractors, agents, and third-party service providers ONLY, who need to know the information to provide, operate, develop, maintain, support, and optimize our service experience and security. We use password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all user information. Due to the inherent nature of the internet and related technology, we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control against loss, misuse, or alteration.
11.Your Rights
We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.
- Access and Updates. We strive to let you access and control the personal information that we have about you. There are limits, though, to the requests we’ll accommodate. We may reject a request for several reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful. You can access and update your account information right in the app by visiting the app’s Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information that we may have, you can put in a request here. Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. You can also remove our service from your mobile device or process account deletion.
- Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can revoke your consent by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
- Erasure. You have the right to request that your personal information be deleted in certain circumstances. Please note that your right to erasure may be limited if the data are necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.” - Restriction on Processing: You have the right to object to and ask for restrictions on the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.
- Objection: You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing your personal information. HOLLA shall no longer process the personal information unless HOLLA demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
12.Removal of Your Information and Data
You can choose to remove your data anytime you want. If you ask us to delete your account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove your data from our servers, subject to any applicable legal or other requirements to maintain certain records of your personally identifiable data. Please note that the deletion of your personally identifiable data from our database may result in us being unable to provide you with the Service. If you need to delete any data or personal information we may have, you can tap “Me-Settings-About HOLLA-Delete Account.” Still, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you delete your personal information.
13. Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others
We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies on the services. These companies may collect information about how you use the services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.
Additionally, some companies may use the information they collect on our services to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. HOLLA does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in the future, we will provide information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy.
