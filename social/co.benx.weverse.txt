Your personal information is protected by password and encrypted
information. However, your information can be exposed to others

negligence or the fundamental nature and risks of the internet.
Your personal information is protected with a password and
encrypted information by default, and important data are
protected with separate security functions by encrypting files
and transmitted date.
We use vaccine programs to prevent possible damage by computer
viruses, and vaccine programs are updated periodically.
We prevent leakage and damage of personal information caused by
hacking and viruses by monitoring the system 24 hours a day
using a system that detects and blocks external intrusion.
We fully acknowledge the importance of your personal information,
and accordingly, we have a reasonably limited number of employees
handling personal information. The personnel in charge of protecting
personal information conducts periodical education for the
employees, putting the utmost effort to protect personal
information. Also, we periodically check the compliance status of
commitments stated in the policy and relevant employees, and when we
detect any violation, we immediately correct and improve the issue
and take necessary measures.
