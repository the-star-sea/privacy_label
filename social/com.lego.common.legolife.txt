It’s great that you’d like to know more about how we keep your information safe. This policy will give you information about how we look after your personal data when you visit or use our services or our applications (apps). The Privacy Policy also tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you. Finally, this Privacy Policy covers both our online and offline data collection activities, including personal data that we may collect through our various channels such as websites, apps, third-party social networks, retail stores, points of sales and events.This is our overall Privacy Policy. For some jurisdictions, additional country/state-specific provisions apply. Click here to be directed to the specific provisions.In other words, if you’re looking for more information on how we collect, store, use and share your personal data, this is the place for you!Who is responsible for your personal data?The LEGO Group is made up of several different legal entities spread around the world. You can read more about the LEGO Group here https://www.LEGO.com/aboutus.This Privacy Policy is issued on behalf of all the companies in the LEGO Group where LEGO System A/S is the data controller (the one responsible and in charge of the data). In some circumstances a local LEGO Group entity has identified their own data controller for their local country where local processing is taking place. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, when we use “we”, “us” or “our” in this Policy, we are talking about LEGO System A/S.We have appointed a data protection officer (‘DPO’) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us. You can also send a letter to the DPO at:   LEGO System A/S   Aastvej 1,   7190 Billund,   Denmark   Att: DPOPlease include your name and country to which your inquiry relates.Your privacy rightsAs a data subject, you have the following rights in respect of the personal data we hold on you:Request access to your personal data. You have a right to access the personal data we are keeping about you. In many cases, this information is already present to you in your online services from us. Your right to access may, however, be restricted by legislation, protection of other persons’ privacy and consideration for the LEGO Group’s business practices, know-how, business secrets and internal assessments.Request correction of incorrect or incomplete data. If the data we have pertaining to you are incorrect or incomplete, you are entitled to have the data corrected, with the restrictions that follow from legislation.Request erasure You have the right to request deletion of your data when:the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;you withdraw your consent to the processing and there is no other legitimate reason for processing;you object to the processing and there is no justified reason for continuing the processing; orthe processing is unlawful.Please note that, in certain circumstances, we may be required to retain some of your personal data after you have requested deletion to satisfy our legal or contractual obligations. We may also be permitted by applicable laws to retain some of your personal data to satisfy our business needs.Limitation of processing of personal data. If you contest the correctness of the data which we have registered about you or lawfulness of processing, or if you have objected to the processing of the data in accordance with your right to object, you may request us to restrict the processing of this data. The processing will be restricted to storage only, until the correctness of the data can be established, or it can be checked whether our legitimate interests override your interests. Even when processing of your data has been restricted as described above, the LEGO Group may process your data in other ways if this is necessary to enforce a legal claim or to process previously collected data if you have earlier given your consent.Object to processing based on our legitimate interest. You can always object to the processing of personal data about you which is based on legitimate interest. If we are processing your data for direct marketing and profiling in connection to such marketing, your objection will always be sustained. For objections to processing for other purposes, we will conduct a legitimate interest balancing test and consider whether to support your objection.Data portability. You have a right to receive personal data that you have provided to us in a machine-readable format.

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:Identity Data includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth and gender.Contact Data includes billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.Financial Data includes bank account and payment card details.Transaction Data includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.Technical Data includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.Profile Data includes your username and password.Purchaser Data includes purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, and feedback or survey responses.Usage Data includes information about how you use our website, products and services.Marketing and Communications Data includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties, participate in sweepstakes and other prize competitions and your communication preferences.We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.

However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.We use Pseudonymized Data in order to minimize the privacy impact to you.Pseudonymization is a method that replaces or removes information in the dataset that identifies an individual but permits a data controller or third party to reidentify the personal data with reasonable effort.

Cookies are small data files that your browser places on your computer or device. A cookie itself does not contain or collect information. However, when it is read by a server via a web browser, it can help a website deliver a more user-friendly service – for example, remembering previous purchases or account details.For more information about cookies and how to manage them, please read our full Cookie Policy and Cookie Declaration. or click on your cookie settings on LEGO.com or in the digital game or app (where applicable).SECTION 4: INFORMATION FOR PARENTSInformation for parents: how the LEGO Group handles children’s personal dataKeeping children safe onlineWe care deeply about making sure children are safe online and have extra privacy processes in place to make sure we’re keeping our younger fans safe when they’re using our online channels. In fact, some features have age gates to prevent children from inadvertently using such features. We also take all reasonable care to ensure that we don’t knowingly collect, store, use or process personal information from children who may use those features without proper parental consent.We’ve joined a digital child safety program which audits our company on a yearly basis to make sure we follow the rules in the way we interact with children online.When it comes to personal data, we consider anyone under the age of 16 years a child and seek parental consent.If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us.If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. To view a list of properties covered by our dispute resolution provider, please click the seal located at the top of this section.When we do process personal information from children, we take extra steps to protect their privacy including:Making sure we tell parents what personal information we collect, store, use and process from their child and explaining whether we share the information;Meeting legal requirements by asking for parental consent to collect, use and process a child’s data and asking for consent to send their children information about our products and services;Limiting how we collect, store, use and process personal information from children so only data that is reasonably needed for them to take part in an online activity is collected;Giving parents access or the option to ask for access to personal information we’ve collected from their child – parents can also ask for their children’s personal information to be changed or deleted.Collecting and using children’s informationWhile some of our websites, channels and apps are designed with families and users of all ages in mind, others are intended to be used mainly by children. Whenever we collect personal information from a child, we only keep the information for the time we need it to provide a service or for the time it’s legally required to be kept on record.While children can choose whether to share their information with us, there are features of our websites that won’t function if they haven’t given us their information. Where personal information is needed for features to function, we’ll only ask for information that is reasonably required to take part in the activity.Here are some examples of times when we collect children’s data:When children register online. Children can register on our websites to access a variety of services including content, games and competitions. During registration, we may ask a child to provide their parent’s or guardian’s email address, the child’s first name, gender, their birth date, their username and password. We use this information for security and notification reasons. We strongly encourage children to create a username that excludes any personal information.When children share content they’ve created themselves. Some of our websites allow children to create or use content themselves. Since only some of these features require personal information from the child, not all activities require consent from a parent or guardian. Whenever an activity could potentially allow a child to share personal information, we’ll ask the parent or guardian for ‘verifiable parental consent’ (which is a higher level of parental consent). Examples of personal data could be stories, free-text fields, drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information, photographs of the child, sound clips, movie files or any type of content or other persistent identifiers that clearly identifies the child in some way.When children enter contests and sweepstakes. If a child wants to enter a competition, we ask for the personal information we need for a child to take part. We usually only ask for the child’s first name (so we can tell the difference between children from the same family) and the email address of a parent or guardian (so we meet legal requirements to notify the responsible adult). We’ll only contact the parent if the child wins the contest or sweepstake to find out where to send the prize. If the competition asks the child to create content to enter, we may need to ask for parental consent by email in advance to ensure we meet the privacy requirements for content children have created themselves (please see the information above about children creating content). Without consent, children won’t be able to take part in our competitions.When children receive emails from us. We may need to ask for a child’s contact details (including their email address) so that we can reply to a question they’ve asked us. If we need to get in touch with the child a second time, for example to reply to additional questions, we request an email address from their parent or guardian. We then only keep the child’s online contact information for the time it takes us to honor their request and wouldn’t use the information for any other purpose. If we ever need a child’s online contact information for ongoing communication, we ask for the parent’s or guardian’s email address at the earliest opportunity so that we can keep the adult informed of the data we’re collecting and to give the parent an option to ask us to stop collecting data. Parents or guardians can opt out of any communication we have with their child at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions within each communication (if there is more than one type of communication, the adult may need to opt out of each individually). Alternatively, they can contact our LEGO® Customer Service team.When children receive app push notifications. Many apps send users ‘push notifications’ to their customers’ mobile phones or devices to tell them about updates (sometimes even when the app is not in use). Some of our apps are designed to be used by children. We ask children to provide the email address of their parent or guardian so we can tell the adult about their child’s request before we send children push notifications from our apps. We don’t link the device identifier with any other personal information without parental consent. If you would like your child to stop receiving push notifications from one of our apps, you can change the settings on the device your child is using at any time.When we collect location information. Some of our websites, channels and apps are designed for children. We request consent from a parent or guardian by email before collecting information on a child’s street name, address or coordinates. We do that because such information will effectively make us able to identify a specific child. On the other hand, we don’t require parental consent to collect information on a child’s city, country or region as long as it isn’t linked directly to the specific child. The reason for this is that such generic information will not make us able to identify a specific child. If you would like us to stop collecting this type of location information, you can adjust the settings on the device your child is using at any time. Alternatively, please contact our LEGO Customer Service team.When we collect ‘persistent identifiers’. In order to give visitors to our online channels more relevant and personalized online experiences, we collect some types on information (e.g. information on IP addresses, mobile device identifier, browsers, internet service providers, referring pages, exit pages, visitor frequency, operating systems, date stamps, time stamps and clickstream data). We collect this information using technologies such as cookies, pixels, flash cookies, web beacons and other unique identifiers (which we define under the Cookie section of this Privacy Policy). We may collect this information ourselves or ask a third party to process the data on our behalf. We use this data to give children access to online features and activities, to customize content, to improve our online channels, to analyze the performance of our online channels and to create anonymous reports. If we ever want to collect children’s personal data for any reason, we would contact the child’s parent or guardian for consent in advance. A list of third-party operators who collect ‘persistent identifiers’ on our sites and apps can be found in our Cookie Policy and Cookie Declaration.Requesting parental consentWe use different types of parental consent depending on what type of children’s data we are processing and for what purpose.Asking for parental consent by emailIf we need to collect a child’s personal information to provide a service requested by the child, we’ll ask for parental consent according to legal requirements (e.g. COPPA for the US and GDPR for EU). We’ll send the child’s parent or guardian an email explaining what information we’re collecting, how we plan to use it and ask the parent to give or deny their consent. If we don’t receive parental consent in a reasonable time, we’ll delete all information we’ve collected from the child, including the adult’s contact information that we asked for in order to request consent.Asking for ‘verified parental consent’If a child wants to share personal information publicly or with a third party via one of our websites or digital experiences, we’ll seek a higher level of parental consent than the email request described above. We may ask for verification by credit card or other payment method (with a nominal charge involved), or a review of the parent’s government-issued ID.What if a parent or guardian hasn’t been contacted for consent?If a child under the age of 16 accesses an online channel that’s designed for children by using an age gate, we’ll email the child’s parent or guardian before collecting any personal information from the child. If you think that your child is taking part in an online activity that collects their personal information and you or another parent/guardian hasn’t received an email contacting you for consent, please contact us. We won’t use email addresses provided for parental consent for any other purpose unless the adult has expressly opted-in to marketing emails or taken part in an activity which allows email contact.Parental choices and controlsAt any time, parents or guardians can refuse to allow us to use and collect further personal information from their child. Parents or guardians can ask us to delete the personal information we have collected in connection with their child’s account from our records. As personal information is required for some services, deleting a child’s records may result in an account, membership or service being unavailable to the child in the future.If a child has a registered LEGO Account, parents or guardians can access, change or delete the personal information we’ve collected from their child by:Using their child’s username and password to log into their child’s LEGO Account; orGetting in touch with our LEGO Customer Service teamIf you’d prefer to contact us, please let us know your child’s username along with your own telephone number and email address. We’ll need to confirm your identity as the parent or guardian of the child before granting access to the child’s personal information. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.SECTION 5: INFORMATION FOR KIDSInformation for kids: Child-Friendly Privacy InformationWho are we?We are the LEGO Group and we want to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow.
