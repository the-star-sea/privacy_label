Last updated: March 2023
The previous privacy policy can be viewed here.
Your privacy is important to Logitech, so we have created this policy to explain how we process your personal information.
This Statement of Privacy and Security outlines what types of data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect personal information collected by our products, services, applications (apps), software and other devices. Logitech is a group of companies working under their parent company; Logitech Europe S.A. The Logitech company that controls your personal data will vary depending on your relationship with us (whether it be as a customer, partner, contractor or any other relevant relationship).
If you are using our products with our websites, then the Logitech Website Privacy Statement also applies.

We do not sell your personal information, and we will not do so in the future without providing you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out. If you require this notice in an alternative format, please email privacy@logitech.com or call our toll-free number +1 800 711 8156.

Logitech collects and uses various types of personal information when you use its products and services, which are described within the Logitech Product and Web Privacy Policies.
Logitech shares personal data with third parties for business purposes.
Specifically, here are the seven categories of activities for which we share data for business purposes:
Auditing
Security
Debugging and Technical Troubleshooting
Short term, transient use (personal information is not disclosed to third parties and it is not used to build profiles)
Performing Services
Internal Research
Testing or Product/Service Improvement
If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what personal information has been collected about you, how we use, share and disclose it, and to access that information. You also have the right to request that we delete your personal information, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow us to retain and use certain personal information.
We do not sell your personal information. In limited circumstances we share your personal information for advertising. You can “opt-out” of having your personal information used for this purpose by contacting us at support.logitech.com/response-center.
You can learn more about how to submit a data rights request through contact details located within this policy. You may also send your request by email to privacy@logitech.com or call our toll-free number +1 800 711 8156.
An agent may submit a request on your behalf, but you must provide proof that the agent is authorized to do so by providing the agent with a signed letter giving permission to submit a request on your behalf and you must confirm that authorization directly with us by sending an email to privacy@logitech.com.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny you goods or services, charge different prices or rates, or provide a different service level for exercising your privacy rights. However, we may offer certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, discounts or quality levels. Any incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information and will only be collected or processed with your consent.
California’s Shine the Light Law
Separate from the CCPA, California’s Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to ask companies what personal information they share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their goods or services to you unless you request it.

The Privacy Policy applies to these products, but there are a few distinctions as noted below.
Read more
Backup and Transfer of Device Settings
Logitech Options allows you to customize your mice, keyboards, and touchpads on your computer. Logitech Capture software allows you to record video and audio on your computer and change the settings of the camera. This software also offers you the ability to back up your device settings to the cloud so you can transfer those settings to other computers and set up your devices easily.
Information that may be collected includes:
Account information like name, email address, and password to create an account or if you use a third-party open authorization (OAuth2) like Facebook or Google to log in.
Computer information like the name, make, and model of the computer to ensure the device works correctly.

Other device settings like point and scroll settings of your mouse

Read more
Software Updates
Our servers automatically record certain information, including the IP address, the software version, and the connected devices to check for necessary software updates and download the required device images or assets, during and after the installation of our software.
Performance, Diagnostics and Analytics
With your consent, some of our software (like Logitech Options, Capture, Presentation app, Setpoint, and Logitech Control Center) collect and record information about the software, devices, and other information such as:
usage of software features;
customization of your devices;
system hardware and software like OS version;
city-level location information using IP address;
device usage frequency like click, and button count. For example, so that we can analyze the durability and dependability of our products, we may capture how many times each button is used during the course of 24 hours;
Logitech Capture-specific information – we capture scene usage and camera model information. We do not analyze or transmit audio or video from the user.
Logitech Presenters capture when you start and end a presentation, along with the application name and version you are using. We collect this information so that we can help improve functionality.
We do not collect the data you insert while using your mice, keyboards or touchpads. A Keystroke assignment refers to when you customize your device and assign a shortcut, our apps require permission from you in order to perform the assigned shortcut.
Product Functionality
We sometimes collect data like device and application information for product features to function properly. For example, Logitech Flow is a feature in some devices that allows you to seamlessly switch between two or three computers, and transfer text, images, and files from one computer to another. To enable automatic discovery of computers during the setup process of Flow, we may collect your device identifier and IP address.

Circle Cameras and Products
Logitech Circle cameras are wireless cameras and software applications that can be used for a variety of purposes at home and at work. They provide users rich video and audio recordings accessible from a mobile device or computer. The Privacy Policy applies to these products, but there are a few distinctions as noted below.
Read more
Activation and Registration
To activate and register your products, you provide information to us to create an account, including your name, email address, password, credit card (if you subscribe to premium services), camera name, and camera settings.
We also offer activation and registration through third party open authorization (OAuth2) services, such as Facebook, so you can share clips you’ve selected to that service.
While setting up the product, the country code of operation needs to be set. Some operating systems may prompt for location data access when determining the country code of operation.
Circle Video and Audio Recordings
When you use Circle products and services, our servers automatically receive, record, and process data necessary to provide the service as well as information from the devices you use to view or listen to the data, including:
video and audio recordings;
device-specific information like hardware model, operating system version, and device identifiers such as MAC address, mobile network information, router names and meta-data concerning Apple Home Hubs and other Apple HomeKit devices;
service event logging information;
time and date of service use;
on/off, and other interaction with the product;
crashes, system activity, and hardware settings; and
geo-location information (when location services are enabled)
Circle products may send pseudonymous information to an analytics tool, including timestamps, transmission statistics, feature usage, performance metrics, errors, etc. We use the pseudonymous information to provide, enhance, and improve our services, features, technical support and information.
Circle Features
Circle products have features that, if enabled, require us to collect and analyze data intelligently for them to work. For example, Smart Location automatically detects when you leave the house or come home, and Smart Alerts intelligently analyze motion to make sure you only get relevant alerts.
Circle Security and Storage
We have implemented Circle products so that no Logitech employee, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or governmental entity can access unencrypted footage. Every Circle camera has a unique private key and digital certificate, which is used to encrypt communications in transit. The Circle servers use AES 256 Bit Dual Layer Encryption to store your footage encrypted-at-rest.
Data collected is stored directly within the application, on your Device, and on servers in the U.S. or other countries where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers have facilities. We will retain collected information for as long as needed to provide the service and in accordance with the Logitech Privacy Policy.
Circle Cameras with Apple HomeKit Support
When a Circle camera is connected to the Apple HomeKit ecosystem, Apple controls the data generated and passed to HomeKit and is responsible for the privacy and handling of your audio and video content. We have no ability or mechanism to access any HomeKit audio/video data.
If a Circle camera is only set up in HomeKit, the camera will still periodically check our servers for firmware update availability. This involves sending the model, firmware version, and the country code of operation to our servers.
If you enable the sharing of diagnostic information with Logitech through the Apple Home App, the following data will be shared with Logitech and/or Apple, and used for troubleshooting purposes only:
device-specific information such as hardware model, names, operating system version, device identifiers such as MAC address, information about nearby wireless networks, and meta-data concerning Apple Home Hubs and other HomeKit devices;
device event logging information;
time and date of device use;
on/off, and other interaction with the Product;
crashes, system activity, hardware settings; and
any additional details submitted by you such as descriptions, screenshots and footage.

Read more
Logitech G Custom Experience
G HUB software allows you to easily configure devices and create commands and macros for games and other applications.

If you opt-in to data analytics collection, when you use G HUB, our servers automatically receive and record information about the use of your product, including:
location information and IP address;
data about when you access G HUB features, such as adjusting DPI, lighting or control configuration;
data related to the discovery of devices you connect, like a new Logitech G mouse or keyboard;
other device and system activity including feature usage, performance metrics, errors, crash data, etc.; and

downloading profiles, lighting, and other settings from the Community Library;
uploading your profiles and effects to share with the community, or for personal storage. You can remove any shared item at any time; and
a personal profile that others in the community can view. You control what is shared in your profile.
You can unsubscribe or delete your G HUB account at any time.
Logitech G Cloud Gaming Handheld
G Cloud is a handheld gaming console on which you can play cloud gaming titles and access cloud streaming services anywhere, at any time. Logitech’s processing of your personal data is limited to the Logitech hardware and the Logitech incorporated software. We collect your unique device ID for the core functioning of your console, to ensure it works correctly. There is also certain personal data collected for the core functioning that is only processed and stored locally on your console, such as your country or region for network connectivity.
If you choose to share your diagnostics and device usage data, we will receive information about your use of the console, such as your battery and charging experience, your usage of the buttons and joysticks and the audio ports. We use this information to improve our products and services.

This data is used to authenticate and associate you to your account and devices. You can also activate and register through third party open authorization (OAuth2) services, such as Facebook.
Harmony Custom Experience
Harmony products let you easily control and create activities or routines that combine commands from multiple devices. Adding information about your entertainment and home automation devices (like brand and model numbers), activities you choose to program (like Watch TV, Listen to Music, etc.), and any specific settings you adjust as part of setting up your product (e.g., customizing buttons) improves your experience. For example, you may actively provide your zip or postal code, your TV service provider and your preferred TV channels, shows and/or programming genres. You will know what you submit in each case, because you will manually enter the information.
We store this information to prevent the loss of your custom configurations. We also use the following information to ensure that your device works and to enhance the security and stability of our products:
location information and IP address;
data about when you access our software, like the features you access and when you sync your remote;
data related to the discovery of devices in your environment, and your use of product features, like the “help” button or “reboot” actions; and
with your consent where it’s required, information sent to an analytics tool, including feature usage, performance metrics, errors, etc.
