The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it includes more specific and detailed categories of shared and collected data, such as Log Data and Personally Identifiable Information, which are likely to contain personal information that should be protected. The original privacy label lacks clarity and specificity in describing the types of data being shared, such as "App interactions" and "Device or other IDs," which could potentially include personal information that users may want to know is being collected. However, both the original and generated privacy labels could be improved by providing clearer and more concise language, and by specifying the legal basis for data processing under CCPA/GDPR. The privacy policy also needs improvement, as it is not written in clear and concise language and lacks important information, such as the legal basis for data processing and the retention period for personal information.
