Based on CCPA/GDPR, the generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label as it provides more specific details about the personal information collected, the purposes of collection, and the security practices followed to protect the information. The original privacy label only mentions the types of data collected and the purposes of collection, which are not sufficient to provide a complete understanding of the information handling practices. Moreover, the original privacy label does not mention specific security practices followed by the company, which is a requirement under GDPR. On the other hand, the generated privacy label presents a detailed list of personal information collected and the purposes of collection, including the security practices followed by the company. Overall, the generated privacy label is more transparent and provides users with a better understanding of the company's data handling practices, which is essential for complying with CCPA/GDPR.
