Based on CCPA/GDPR, the generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label. The generated privacy label provides more specific and concise information about the collected data and the security practices. It also mentions the retention time of the data and the right of the user to suspend or remove their data. On the other hand, the original privacy label only mentions the purpose and type of collected data, and some of the security practices are vague. Additionally, the privacy policy included in the original privacy label is not comprehensive and lacks important information, such as the types of personal data collected and the data controller's contact information. The generated privacy label is more compliant with the CCPA and GDPR regulations as it provides clearer and more detailed information to the user about their data and privacy rights.
