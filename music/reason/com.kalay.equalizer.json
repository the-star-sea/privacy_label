The generated privacy label appears to be more detailed and informative compared to the original privacy label. It covers a wider range of data, including data that may be voluntarily provided by users, and a more comprehensive list of the purposes of processing and types of data collected. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes clear information about the legal basis for processing personal data for EU persons under GDPR and the right to unsubscribe from marketing communication. 

The original privacy label only mentions data related to app info and performance, device or other IDs, and security practices. It also does not provide adequate information on the deletion of personal data and legal basis for processing under CCPA and GDPR. 

Overall, the generated privacy label is more compliant with CCPA and GDPR regulations and provides a better overview of data collection and processing practices.
