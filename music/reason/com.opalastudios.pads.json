The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more specific information about the type of personal data collected, the purpose of its collection, and the security measures adopted to protect the data. Additionally, it includes information about user consent and control over data processing through privacy settings and cookie management. The original privacy label is not as specific, and some of its information is outdated, relying on the optional field instead of indicating the legal basis for processing. The privacy policy only covers user information, while the generated privacy label includes information on cookies and security measures.
