The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it provides more detailed information about the data collected, including the specific types of location data, device identifiers, and other information. It also includes information about encryption practices and the ability for users to request more information about the use of their data and to edit or remove their data. The original privacy label, on the other hand, provides only general information about the types of data collected and the security practices, without providing specific details or options for users to control their data. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes a clear and comprehensive privacy policy that outlines the purpose and use of the collected data, as well as the third parties and services used, which can provide users with more transparency and trust in the app and its developer.
