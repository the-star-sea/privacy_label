The original privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance compared to the generated privacy label. The original privacy label provides specific information about the types of personal data collected, the purposes for which it is collected, and whether it is optional or mandatory. It also includes information about the security practices implemented to protect user data. The generated privacy label, on the other hand, is more general and does not provide specific details about the personal data collected. While it mentions Apple's commitment to customer privacy and provides links to manage personal data and contact privacy for corrections and inquiries, it offers no specifics on data collection. Therefore, the original privacy label would be more helpful for consumers to make informed decisions about their data privacy based on CCPA/GDPR.
