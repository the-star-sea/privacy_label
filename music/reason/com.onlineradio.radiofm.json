The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance because it provides more specific information about the data that is collected and shared by the app, including the purposes and types of data. It also clearly states the third-party services used by the app and their respective privacy policies. Additionally, the original privacy label includes a security practice that may not be compliant with GDPR’s right to erasure, as it states that data cannot be deleted. In contrast, the generated privacy label does not include this potentially non-compliant practice. The privacy policy also includes information about CCPA privacy rights and how to exercise them, which is important for compliance with this regulation.
