The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance as it provides more detailed and specific information about the data collected, for what purposes it is collected and how it is used. It also includes information about users' data rights and the security measures taken to protect their data. However, it is important to note that the generated privacy label alone is not sufficient for CCPA/GDPR compliance, and a comprehensive privacy policy is required to fully comply with these regulations. The original privacy label lacks the necessary details and may not be sufficient to comply with regulations. Additionally, the privacy policy mentions third-party advertising partners for personalized ads, which should be included in the privacy label as well.
