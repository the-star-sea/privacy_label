The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more comprehensive information on the data collection and security practices of the app. It includes clear details on what data is collected, how it is used, and who has access to it. Additionally, it specifies the app's use of third-party services that collect data and provides links to their privacy policies. The security practices section also presents a better overview of the measures the app takes to protect user data, including the use of commercially acceptable means of protecting data and advisories on external links. Overall, the generated privacy label aligns more closely with the transparency and accountability requirements of CCPA/GDPR and provides users with more confidence in their data privacy.
