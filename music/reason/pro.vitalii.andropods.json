The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label as it provides more detailed information about the type of data being collected, its purpose, and the security practices that are being implemented to protect it. The generated privacy label also mentions the third-party services that are being used and their purpose. It provides information on app permissions and links to other sites. Moreover, it includes a section on children's privacy and policy changes which is required for compliance with both CCPA and GDPR. Overall, the generated privacy label is more comprehensive and detailed, and it provides users with a better understanding of how their personal information is being collected, used, and protected.
