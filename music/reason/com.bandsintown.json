The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides a more comprehensive and transparent overview of the data collected and its purpose. It includes the same information as the original privacy label but also adds additional details such as the inclusion of billing information and regular security audits. It also separates out the shared data and collected data categories, providing greater clarity for users. The privacy policy provided by the company seems to be up to date and comprehensive as well.
