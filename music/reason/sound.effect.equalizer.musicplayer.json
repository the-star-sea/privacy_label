The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR. It includes more specific information about the collected data, purposes, and security practices, and also includes the option of deleting personal data upon request. The original privacy label is less specific and does not provide as much information about data collection and security practices. The privacy policy also includes more detailed information in the generated label compared to the original one. Overall, the generated privacy label is more comprehensive and provides more transparency to users, which is crucial for complying with CCPA and GDPR regulations.
