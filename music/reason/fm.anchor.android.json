The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it is more concise and focused on the specific data categories collected and their purposes. It also provides information about data retention and deletion, as well as safeguards in place to protect personal data. However, it does not include information about the security practices in place, which is included in the original privacy label. Therefore, it would be ideal to combine the two labels to provide a comprehensive overview of data collection, purpose, security practices, and data retention and deletion.
