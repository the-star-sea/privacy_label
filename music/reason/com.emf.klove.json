The generated privacy label seems to be more comprehensive and detailed than the original one. However, it is not possible to say which one is better based on CCPA/GDPR without considering the specific requirements of these regulations. It depends on whether the data collection practices mentioned in the privacy labels comply with the requirements of these regulations or not. Both labels mention the security practices and provide a way to request data deletion, which aligns with CCPA/GDPR requirements. Nonetheless, it is recommended to review the privacy policy and the specific requirements of the regulations to determine compliance.
