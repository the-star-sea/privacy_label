The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it clearly states that the app collects and shares personally identifiable information for the purposes of advertising and service optimization. It also includes information on how the user can request the deletion of their data, which is a requirement under both CCPA and GDPR. However, the original privacy label does not clearly mention the collection of personally identifiable information and does not provide the user with an option to delete their data. Additionally, the privacy policy is detailed and provides the user with information on the legal basis for processing their data, data retention period, and the user's rights.
