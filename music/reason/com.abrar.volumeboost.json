The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it provides more detailed and specific information about the personal data that is being collected and processed, including the purpose and type of data. It also includes security practices that are recommended by GDPR, such as providing a method for data subjects to access, amend, and delete their personal data and using standard contractual clauses for data transfers outside of the EU. The original privacy label is less specific and lacks information about personal data collection and transfer practices. Additionally, the original privacy policy states that the company does not provide a way for users to request that their data be deleted, which is not compliant with CCPA. The generated privacy label includes information about the data subject's rights, including the right to request deletion.
