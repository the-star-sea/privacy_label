The generated privacy label is more comprehensive and effective in protecting the user's privacy than the original privacy label. The generated label provides clear and specific details about the types of data that are collected, the purposes for which they are collected, and their optional or mandatory nature. It also includes detailed information about security practices, including encryption and protection measures, as well as information about a user's right to request deletion of their data. 

Moreover, the privacy policy associated with the generated privacy label provides more details about data collection, security practices, and user's rights than the original policy. The generated policy clearly explains what types of personal information are collected and shared, what measures the company takes to protect user data, how user data is used, and how users can request deletion of their information. 

Overall, the generated privacy label and policy are more in line with privacy regulations such as CCPA and GDPR.
