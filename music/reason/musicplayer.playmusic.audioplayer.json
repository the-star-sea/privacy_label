The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it provides more specific information about what data is collected and how it is used, including information about personal data that may be collected if the user logs in with a social media account, whereas the original label only provided general categories of data collected. The generated label also includes information about third-party analytics platforms and how personal data is shared with third-party service providers, which is important for transparency and accountability under CCPA/GDPR. The privacy policy also includes information about users' rights under CCPA/GDPR, such as the right to access, correct, and delete personal data, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal data for interest-based advertising purposes. Overall, the generated privacy label and privacy policy provide more comprehensive information that is necessary for compliance with CCPA/GDPR.
