The original privacy label provides more detailed information about the data shared and collected, and the security practices followed by the developer. However, the generated privacy label is more comprehensive in terms of the types of data collected and the purposes for which they are used. It also provides information about third-party advertising partners and how they collect and use data.

Based on CCPA/GDPR, the original privacy label may not be sufficient as it lacks information about certain types of data collected and shared, such as IP address, advertising ID, and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies. The generated privacy label, on the other hand, provides this information and thus, is more compliant with CCPA/GDPR. However, both labels need to be reviewed in the context of the specific requirements applicable to the developer and the service offered.
