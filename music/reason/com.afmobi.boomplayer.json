The generated privacy label seems to be more comprehensive than the original one as it covers more types of collected and shared data. It also includes information about behavioral advertising and data from third-party sources. This is aligned with the requirements of both CCPA and GDPR as they require companies to provide detailed information about the types of data they collect, how they use it, and who they share it with. However, it is important to note that the privacy policy itself is also important as it sets out the specific practices and procedures for data collection, use, and protection. The privacy policy should also provide users with their rights in terms of accessing, rectifying, and deleting their personal data. As such, it is also important to assess the privacy policy in conjunction with the privacy label to determine the overall data protection practices of the company.
