The original privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR laws because it provides more detailed information about the types of data collected, the purpose for which it is collected, and whether it is optional or mandatory to share. Additionally, the original privacy label provides information about security practices and includes a privacy policy URL for users to read and reference. The generated privacy label only provides information about log data and device information collected for app performance monitoring and improvement, with no mention of user data or the purpose for which it is collected. Additionally, the generated privacy label only provides information about security practices with no privacy policy URL. Overall, the original privacy label provides more transparency and comprehensive information for users to make informed decisions about their privacy.
