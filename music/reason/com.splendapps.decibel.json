The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more specific information on the data collected and shared by the app. The original privacy label only provided general information on data encryption and data deletion, which is not enough to comply with the CCPA/GDPR. On the other hand, the generated privacy label provides a detailed list of the collected data types and their purposes. It also includes information on third-party service providers and interactions with other users which are important to know for data privacy. In addition, it mentions the policy for children explicitly which is required by the CCPA. The privacy policy also covers the rights of users to request deletion of their data which is essential for GDPR compliance. Therefore, the generated privacy label and privacy policy are better for CCPA/GDPR compliance.
