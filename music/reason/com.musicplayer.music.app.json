The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more comprehensive information regarding the collection, use, and sharing of personal data. It includes specific examples of personal data collected and the purposes for which they are used, and also mentions the third-party advertising companies with whom non-personal data may be shared. Additionally, it provides details about the legal obligations for disclosure and transfer of personal data. The original privacy label is very limited and does not provide sufficient information to an individual about their personal data. Ultimately, the generated privacy label is more aligned with the privacy requirements of CCPA/GDPR.
