The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance as it includes more comprehensive information about the app's data collection, processing, sharing practices, and users' rights. It also ensures transparency and provides users with more control and choices over their data. In addition, it includes specific security practices that the app is implementing to protect users' data from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. Moreover, the privacy policy provides clear information on how the app collects users' data, how it uses it, and how users can exercise their rights under the CCPA/GDPR. However, the original privacy label has limited information, and it includes some practices that may conflict with the CCPA/GDPR, such as not providing users with the ability to delete their data upon request.
