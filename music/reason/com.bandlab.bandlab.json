The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance as it clearly identifies the type of personal information collected and its purpose, and provides information on international data transfers, which is a requirement under these privacy laws. Additionally, it mentions lawful bases for data processing and informs users of their rights to object and request deletion of their data. The security practices section also includes a description of safeguards in place for international data transfers, which is important for compliance. In contrast, the original privacy label does not provide clear and specific information on the type of personal information collected, its purpose, or the lawful basis for data processing. The security practices section only provides a brief description of two practices and does not include information on international data transfers.
