The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more specific information about the types of data collected, the purpose of the data collection, and whether the data is optional or required. It also includes information about security practices used to protect the data and how long the data is retained. The original privacy label is too vague and does not provide enough information for users to make informed decisions about their data. The generated privacy label better aligns with the transparency and control requirements of GDPR/CCPA.
