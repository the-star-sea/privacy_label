In terms of compliance with CCPA/GDPR, the generated privacy label seems to be better as it provides specific information required by the regulations, such as the use of cookies, financial transaction data, and restrictions on child usage. However, it is important to note that the privacy policy provided by the app should also be reviewed to ensure complete compliance with the regulations.
