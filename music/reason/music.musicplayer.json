Both privacy labels provide some information about the data collected, shared, and stored by the mobile application and how it is safeguarded. However, the generated privacy label seems to be more comprehensive as it provides more data categories that are covered in the CCPA and GDPR, such as personal info and financial info. The original privacy label only mentions crash logs, diagnostics, and device IDs, which may not be sufficient to fully inform users about their data privacy rights. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better suited for compliance with the CCPA and GDPR.
