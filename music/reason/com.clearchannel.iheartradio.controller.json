The generated privacy label appears to be incomplete, as it does not include any collected data. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether it is better or worse than the original privacy label in terms of compliance with CCPA/GDPR. It is important for privacy labels to clearly and accurately disclose what information is being collected, for what purpose, and with whom it is being shared. Without this information, users are unable to make informed decisions about their privacy. Therefore, the original privacy label may be preferable as it provides more detailed information about the data being collected and shared.
