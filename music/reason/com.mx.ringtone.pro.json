The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more specific information about the data collected, the purpose for which it is collected, and how it is used and shared. The original privacy label only mentions the general data types and purpose without providing specific details. The generated privacy label also includes information on user-generated content (photos submitted by users) and the permissions used by the app. However, the privacy policy could be improved by providing more clarity regarding how users can control the collection, correction, and deletion of their information, as well as their rights under CCPA/GDPR. It also needs to include information on users’ rights to access, rectification, and erasure of their personal data, as well as the right to object to processing.
