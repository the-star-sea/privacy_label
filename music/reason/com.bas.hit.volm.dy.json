The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it provides more specific information about the types of data collected, the purposes for collecting them, and the security measures in place. The original privacy label only provides very general information on security practices without specifying what data is being collected and for what specific purposes. Additionally, the original privacy label states that there is no way for users to request deletion of their data, which may not comply with CCPA/GDPR requirements for data subject rights. The generated privacy label provides more detailed information on security practices and explicitly states that no personal information is collected, which may better align with the principles of CCPA/GDPR.
