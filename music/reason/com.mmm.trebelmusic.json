The original privacy label and the generated privacy label have different sets of collected and shared data, and security practices. Both privacy labels suggest that the collected data will be used for advertising and marketing purposes. However, the generated privacy label provides more detailed information than the original privacy label on how the collected information will be used.

Based on CCPA/GDPR, the generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label. The original privacy label does not address specific requirements under CCPA/GDPR, such as the provision of opt-out options for the users, specific retention periods for collected information, or sharing of information with third-party service providers. On the other hand, the generated privacy label provides more granular information on how user information is collected, used, shared, and protected.

In terms of the security practices, the original privacy label mentions that the data is transferred over a secure connection and provides a way for the user to request their data to be deleted. The generated privacy label mentions electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information and does not provide any information on how users can request data deletion. Therefore, the original privacy label has better security practices, but the generated privacy label provides more detailed information on data collection and usage.
