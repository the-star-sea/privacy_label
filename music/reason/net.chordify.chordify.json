The generated privacy label seems to contain more specific information regarding the types of data that are collected, the purpose of collecting this data and the legal basis for processing it. However, it is important to note that the generated privacy label lacks information about the rights of the users under the CCPA/GDPR, such as the right to access, rectify, delete or restrict the processing of their personal data, or the right to object to the processing of their data for certain purposes. Therefore, in terms of complying with CCPA/GDPR, the original privacy label may be better as it provides more information about the users' rights. However, both labels seem to have room for improvement in terms of providing clear information regarding the users' rights under applicable privacy laws.
