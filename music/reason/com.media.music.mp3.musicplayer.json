Based on CCPA/GDPR, the generated privacy label is better as it specifically states that no personally identifiable information is collected, which is a requirement under these regulations. The original privacy label is more general and lacks detail about the types of data collected. However, both labels mention security practices and provide a privacy policy URL, which are also important requirements under CCPA/GDPR. The privacy policy itself appears to be in compliance with these regulations by stating that no personally identifiable information is collected.
