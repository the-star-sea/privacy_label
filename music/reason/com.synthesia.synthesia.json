The generated privacy label provides more specific information on the data collected and its purpose, which is better for compliance with both CCPA and GDPR. However, it does not provide any security practices, which are important for compliance with GDPR. The original privacy label includes security practices, but it is not as specific about the data collected and its purpose. Overall, a combination of both the original privacy label and the generated privacy label would be better for compliance with CCPA and GDPR.
