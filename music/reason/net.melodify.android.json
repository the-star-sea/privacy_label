The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance because it explicitly states the purpose for which personal information is collected and how it is used. The original privacy label only provides a brief description of the data collected and general purposes, without specifying the legal basis or lawful purpose for the processing of the data. The generated privacy label also assures the user that the developer uses commercially acceptable means of protecting data, which aligns with the security standards required under CCPA/GDPR. However, it does not disclose the specific security measures taken to protect personal information, which can be improved. Overall, the generated privacy label is more comprehensive and provides clearer information to the user, making it more compliant with CCPA/GDPR.
