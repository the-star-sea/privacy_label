The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compared to the original privacy label. The generated privacy label provides a more comprehensive and detailed list of data collected, including usage data, device identifiers, information from third-party apps, personal data, and analytics data. It also includes security practices such as secure storage and personal data deletion, which are important for compliance with GDPR and CCPA. 

In contrast, the original privacy label only includes limited data like app interactions, crash logs, diagnostics and device or other IDs, and only provides basic security practices such as data encryption in transit and data deletion request. It is important to provide users with clear and comprehensive information about data collection, usage, and security practices, especially in order to comply with the regulations like GDPR and CCPA. 

Additionally, the generated privacy label includes information about Google Analytics, which is essential for users to understand how their data may be processed by a third party. It also includes information about user rights under CCPA, which is necessary for compliance with this regulation. 

Moreover, the privacy policy is detailed and transparent, providing users with information about the collection of non-personally identifiable information, app permissions, law enforcement, analytics, and protection of personal data. It also includes a section on user rights under CCPA, indicating a commitment to complying with this regulation.
