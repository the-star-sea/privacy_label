The generated privacy label seems to be more specific and detailed as it includes information about the mobile device unique identification ID, mobile telephone number, other application information, non-precise location information (e.g., zip code), and targeted advertising data. In addition, it mentions the involvement of third-party advertisers and advertising networks that collect and use user data for advertising purposes and provides details on how to opt-out of their data collection practices. 

However, it should be noted that both privacy labels meet the standards of the CCPA and GDPR as they provide information about the types of data collected, the purposes of data collection, and the security practices used to protect the data. 

Overall, the generated privacy label is recommended as it is more detailed and specific in terms of providing information about data collection and advertising practices.
