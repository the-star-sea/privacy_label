The original privacy label provides more detailed and specific information about the shared and collected data. It also includes information about security practices, which is important for users to understand how their data is being protected. However, the generated privacy label includes information on opting out of certain advertising features and broader protection standards, which is also crucial for users to know, particularly in the context of CCPA and GDPR compliance. Therefore, both labels have their strengths, but if we were to choose one based on CCPA/GDPR compliance, the original privacy label is better.
