The generated privacy label seems to be more comprehensive as it includes specific categories of data collected, purposes of processing and practices related to security, as required by both CCPA and GDPR. It also highlights compliance with data protection laws when transferring personal information outside designated regions. The original privacy label lacks clarity in some areas, such as not specifying whether data is encrypted, and its security practices seem inadequate. Additionally, the original label does not explicitly include all the personal information collected, making it less transparent overall. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better suited for CCPA/GDPR compliance.
