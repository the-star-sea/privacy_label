The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance because it provides more detailed and specific information about the data being collected and shared. The original privacy label lacked some important information, such as specific device and network information being collected, and did not provide an option for users to request data deletion. The generated label also includes a section on cookies and third-party advertisements, which is important information for users to know under CCPA/GDPR regulations. The privacy policy further provides information about how the collected data is used and shared, and offers a way for users to contact the company with any complaints. Overall, the generated privacy label and privacy policy are more comprehensive and informative, which is essential for ensuring transparency and compliance with privacy regulations.
