The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR. It provides more detailed information about the data collected, the purpose of the data collection, and the security practices. It also includes information about data minimization, third-party data sharing, cross-border data transfers, and consent withdrawal, which are important requirements of GDPR. Additionally, the privacy policy provides more specific information about how personal data is collected, used, and shared, and includes a dedicated section for California residents, which is required by CCPA. Overall, the generated privacy label and privacy policy appear to be more comprehensive and transparent than the original privacy label.
