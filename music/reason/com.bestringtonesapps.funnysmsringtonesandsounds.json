The generated privacy label is better in terms of compliance with CCPA and GDPR as it includes more specific information about the types of data collected and the purposes of the collection. It also provides information about third-party advertisers and their use of data, as well as opt-out options. However, the original privacy label is still comprehensive and includes information on shared data, collected data, and security practices. It also includes a link to the privacy policy, which provides additional details about data collection and use. Overall, both labels are useful but the generated label is more detailed and specific.
