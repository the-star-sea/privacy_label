The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more detailed information regarding the data being collected and its purpose. It also mentions that the app uses third-party services and provides links to their privacy policies. However, the original privacy label only mentions security practices and a link to the app's privacy policy URL which is less informative. The privacy policy itself seems to provide adequate information but could be improved by adding more details about the type of data being collected and how it is used.
