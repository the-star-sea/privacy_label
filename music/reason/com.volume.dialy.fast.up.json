Based on CCPA/GDPR, the generated privacy label is better compared to the original one. The generated privacy label provides more detailed information about the data collected, the purpose of data collection, and the type of data collected. It also specifies that non-personal information is protected using security measures and that personal information is not knowingly collected from children under 13. However, the original privacy label is less detailed and does not provide complete information about the collected data. The privacy policy describes the collection of IP addresses, hardware information, and other statistics, which are personal data. Therefore, the generated privacy label is more aligned with the requirements of GDPR/CCPA. However, the privacy policy could be more transparent and state that such personal data is also being collected.
