The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides clearer and more comprehensive information about the data being shared and collected. It also includes more details about security practices, including a disclaimer that absolute security cannot be guaranteed, which is required by GDPR. The original privacy label lacks details about the type of personal information being collected and shared, as well as information on how data can be deleted or how users can opt-out, which are important requirements under CCPA. Additionally, the original privacy policy URL provided redirects to a blogspot page, which is not a secure or adequate means for providing a privacy policy. Therefore, the generated privacy label is more compliant with data protection regulations than the original privacy label.
