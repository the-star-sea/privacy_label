The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it includes comprehensive information about the personal data collected by the app, including the purpose, type, and optional status. The original privacy label only provided general information about security practices and a link to the privacy policy, which may not be sufficient for users to fully understand how their personal data is being used. The privacy policy also includes information about data sharing with third-party service providers and interactions with other users, which is important for transparency and compliance with privacy regulations. However, the privacy policy should include a clear statement about the app's compliance with GDPR and CCPA, as well as specific contact information for users to exercise their privacy rights.
