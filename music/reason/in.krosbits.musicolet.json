The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more specific information about the collected data, including the type of data, the purpose of collecting it, and whether it is optional or not. It also includes information about security practices and how collected data are deleted. The original privacy label only provided a privacy policy URL, but did not give any specific information about collected or shared data. The generated privacy label also follows the principles of data minimization and limiting data sharing, which are important for complying with CCPA/GDPR. Overall, the generated privacy label is more detailed and transparent, which is essential for earning the trust of users and complying with privacy regulations.
