The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance as it provides more detailed information on the specific types of personal data collected and includes information on the lawful basis for processing each data category. The original privacy label only listed general categories of data without specifying the types of personal data collected, which is not sufficient under the CCPA/GDPR. The generated privacy label also includes more information on security practices and data transfers, which are important for ensuring adequate protection of personal data. However, it should be noted that the privacy policy could still be improved by providing more detailed information on the specific third-party service providers used and their respective privacy policies.
