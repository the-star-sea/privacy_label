Based on CCPA/GDPR, the generated privacy label is better as it provides more details about the collected data, including Personally Identifiable Information, anonymous individual and aggregate data, as well as third-party payment processing information. It also includes information about the use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies for assessing the performance of the service. The security practices section includes details about encryption of sensitive data, international data transfers, opt-out feature, and cookie-based opt-outs. The original privacy label only mentions email address, crash logs, diagnostics, and device or other IDs in the collected data section, and provides limited information about security practices. The generated privacy label provides more transparency and includes all the information required by CCPA/GDPR.
