The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR. The original privacy label does not adequately disclose the collected and shared data types, along with their purpose and type, and also misses out on important security practices such as encryption at rest. The generated privacy label is more detailed in specifying the collected and shared data types along with the purpose, type, and whether it is optional or not. It also includes more comprehensive security practices such as encryption at rest. However, the app's privacy policy needs improvements as it only refers to the third-party providers' privacy policies and does not provide users with enough information on how their data is used, stored, or shared.
