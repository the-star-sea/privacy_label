The original privacy label provides more comprehensive information about the specific types of data being collected, the purposes for which they are being collected, and the types of practices in place to protect the data. Additionally, it includes a privacy policy URL that users can use to access more detailed information about the app's privacy practices. Furthermore, the original privacy label appears to be aligned with CCPA/GDPR regulations, as it provides transparency about the data being collected and explains how users can request the deletion of their data.

On the other hand, the generated privacy label appears to be much narrower, only listing two general categories of shared data and not indicating specific types of collected data. It also includes two security practices but does not explain how these practices are implemented. As a result, the generated privacy label may not provide enough information for users to make informed decisions about whether or not to use the app and how the data they provide is being used, and it does not meet the requirements of CCPA/GDPR.
