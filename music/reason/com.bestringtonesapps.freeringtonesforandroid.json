Based on CCPA/GDPR, the generated privacy label is better as it provides more specific and detailed information on the data collected and its purposes. The original privacy label only lists general categories of data, while the generated privacy label specifies the exact data collected and the purposes for which it is used. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes information on third-party advertisers and their collection of data, which is important for transparency. The privacy policy also includes information on GDPR compliance and specifically states that they do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. However, it is worth noting that the privacy policy does not provide information on the individual's rights under CCPA/GDPR, such as the right to access and delete their data.
