The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more comprehensive information about the data collected, processed, and transferred by the company, including both personal and non-personal data. The original privacy label only provides limited information about the data collected for analytics and account management purposes, and does not mention the legal basis or the rights of the users under GDPR. In contrast, the generated privacy label clearly states the purposes of processing each type of data, the legal basis for processing, and the rights of the users. Additionally, the generated privacy label mentions the use of service providers, their compliance with data protection laws, and the location of data transfers, which is important information for compliance under CCPA/GDPR. Overall, the generated privacy label is more transparent and informative than the original one.
