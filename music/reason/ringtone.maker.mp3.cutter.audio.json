The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more specific information about the collected data, including the purpose for which it is collected and the type of personal information collected. Additionally, it includes more comprehensive security practices, such as not using personal information for marketing purposes and not disclosing personal information to third parties for commercial gains. 

However, it should be noted that the original privacy label does mention that data is encrypted in transit and provides a way for users to request that their data be deleted, which are both important security practices. The privacy policy also states that PII is not collected from users unless voluntarily provided and is only used for contacting them and improving services. 

Overall, both the original and generated privacy labels and privacy policy are important in providing transparency about data collection and usage and it is advisable for companies to include all relevant information to comply with CCPA/GDPR.
