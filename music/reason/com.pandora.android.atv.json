The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it provides more specific and concise information about the data that is collected, the purposes for which it is collected, and the security practices in place to protect it. The original label provides a lot of information, but it is not organized in a way that is easy to understand or compare to CCPA/GDPR requirements. The generated label also includes information about the user's rights under these laws, such as the right to opt-out of certain data processing and the right to request correction or deletion of personal information. The privacy policy provides additional information about data collection, the use of cookies, and the sharing of data with third-party providers. Overall, the generated privacy label and privacy policy are more transparent and compliant with privacy regulations than the original label.
