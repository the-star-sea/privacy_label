The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it provides more specific information about the data that is collected and shared. It also includes a section about service providers, which is important for compliance with CCPA/GDPR. Additionally, the security practices section in the generated privacy label provides clearer information about how personal information is protected. The original privacy label is less specific about the data that is collected and shared, and does not include information about service providers. Overall, the generated privacy label provides more comprehensive information to users about how their personal data is collected and used.
