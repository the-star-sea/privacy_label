The generated privacy label is better than the original one based on CCPA/GDPR regulations. The original privacy label only discloses one type of collected data for advertising or marketing purposes, and it does not provide sufficient information about security practices and shared data. On the other hand, the generated privacy label lists several types of collected data with detailed purposes, and it provides more information on security practices and shared data. The generated privacy label also includes information about personalization, analytics, and measurement purposes, which are crucial for CCPA/GDPR compliance. However, the privacy policy mentions data sharing with partners, but it does not specify the exact third parties and the purpose of the sharing, which might not be fully compliant with CCPA/GDPR.
