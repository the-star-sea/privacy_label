The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it provides more specific and detailed information about the data collected, shared, and its purpose. It also includes additional security practices, such as third-party data protection and communication of privacy policy changes, which comply with the regulations. The original privacy label lacks transparency and does not clearly state the purpose of data collection or guarantees the protection of personal data. Furthermore, the privacy policy is too general and vague, which may confuse users and does not properly inform them about their privacy rights. Therefore, the generated privacy label provides more comprehensive, accurate, and understandable information, which is crucial for meeting the standards of CCPA/GDPR requirements.
