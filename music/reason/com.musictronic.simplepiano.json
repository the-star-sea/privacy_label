The generated privacy label is better than the original one based on the CCPA/GDPR compliance. The original privacy label lacks the necessary information required by the CCPA/GDPR regulations, such as the types of data collected, purposes of data processing, and security practices. On the other hand, the generated privacy label covers all the relevant information required by both CCPA/GDPR and provides transparency to the users. The shared data in the generated privacy label specifies the type of personal information collected, the purpose of data processing, and the data type. The collected data section covers the usage data and other similar contact data along with the purpose of data processing. The security practices section highlights the data protection measures and the privacy control options available to the users. Finally, the privacy policy mentions the age limit to access the site, privacy rights, and how to contact the site for resolving privacy-related queries.
