The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it includes more details about the collected and shared data and security practices of the app. It also includes information about data processing purposes, retention period, and data protection rights of users. The original privacy label only provided limited information about the collected data and security practices and did not provide details on data processing purposes, retention period, and data protection rights. The privacy policy included with the generated privacy label also provided more detailed information about the information collected through the app and the rights of users to manage their personal data.
