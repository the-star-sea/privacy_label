The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance as it provides more detailed information about the types of data collected, the purpose of its collection, and its security practices. The original privacy label only mentions the collection of "App Interactions" for analytics purposes and provides limited information about security practices. On the other hand, the generated privacy label provides information about various types of data collected, such as device information, user feedback data, and usage data, and their purposes, such as device functionality, personalization, and protection. It also includes security measures to protect non-personal information and states that no personal information is collected. In addition, the generated privacy label mentions third-party advertising and analytic services, which is important for transparency and compliance with CCPA/GDPR regulations. Finally, both privacy labels provide a privacy policy URL and the option to delete collected data upon request, which is also required for GDPR/CCPA compliance.
