The generated privacy label seems to be more comprehensive and specific compared to the original privacy label. It includes additional data types like "Device information", "Connection information", "Advertisement Identifiers", and "Google Account Information". It also provides more details on the purpose of using these data types. Furthermore, the generated label specifically mentions that the developer provides a way for users to request data deletion which is important from the GDPR perspective. 

Based on CCPA and GDPR, the generated privacy label is better as it provides more detailed information about the type of data collected and the purposes it is used for. It also mentions the provision for users to request data deletion which is a requirement under GDPR. Overall, a more comprehensive privacy label enables users to make informed decisions and exercise their rights to protect their personal information.
