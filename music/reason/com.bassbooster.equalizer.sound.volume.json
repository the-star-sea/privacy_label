The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it includes more detailed information about the collection and use of personal data, as well as user rights and international transfers of personal data. It also mentions that companies working on behalf of SoulApps must abide by data privacy and security measures. However, the original privacy label is quite vague and only mentions the collection of device IDs for analytics purposes and basic security practices. The privacy policy is also quite vague and needs improvement to comply with CCPA/GDPR requirements. It is important for companies to provide clear and concise privacy labels and policies to ensure transparency and trust with their users.
