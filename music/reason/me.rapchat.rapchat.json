The generated privacy label is more comprehensive and specific than the original privacy label. It provides more detailed information on the types of personal information collected, the purposes for which they are collected, and whether they are optional or mandatory. The security practices section of the generated privacy label also includes additional items that are not found in the original privacy label, such as the use of user information to keep the Services safe and secure and compliance with applicable law. 

Both the original privacy label and the generated privacy label meet the baseline requirements of CCPA/GDPR in terms of disclosing the types of personal information collected and the purposes for which they are collected. However, the generated privacy label provides more clear and specific information, which is more helpful for users to make informed decisions about their privacy. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR.
