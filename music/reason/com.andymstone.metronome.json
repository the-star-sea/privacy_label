The generated privacy label seems to focus on personal information being collected for advertising and in-app purchases with a clear practice for requesting data deletion, while the original privacy label has a wider scope of shared and collected data for advertising and marketing purposes with no clear practice for requesting data deletion. 

Thus, the generated privacy label appears to be better in terms of clarity and transparency for users under CCPA/GDPR, as it explicitly mentions the personal information that is being collected, the purpose of the collection, and the user's right to request data deletion. However, it is important to note that the privacy policy provided by the app developer also plays a significant role in ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
