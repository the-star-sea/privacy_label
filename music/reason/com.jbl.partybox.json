The generated privacy label is better for CCPA/GDPR compliance as it provides more specific and detailed information about the collection and sharing of personal data, and includes a section specifically addressing California Consumer privacy rights. It also includes information about the location of data storage and processing, as well as the specific security measures in place to protect personal information. However, it is important to note that both labels could still benefit from additional clarity and transparency around the purpose and necessity of data collection and sharing.
