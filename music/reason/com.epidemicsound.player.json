Based on CCPA/GDPR, the original privacy label is better as it provides more detailed information about the data collected and shared, as well as the security practices in place to protect personal information. The generated privacy label only mentions browsing data and has no information about what types of personal information are collected or shared. The privacy policy also only mentions the use of cookies and does not provide sufficient information about data collection and sharing practices. Overall, the original privacy label is more transparent and informative about data privacy practices.
