The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR because it provides more specific and detailed information about the data collected and its purpose, including information about third-party data collection. Additionally, it includes information about user controls and choices, notice of policy updates, and more specific security practices. The original privacy label is less specific and lacks detail in certain areas, such as the purpose for collecting user IDs and other app performance data. The privacy policy also lacks clarity in areas, such as the specific entities responsible for data control. Overall, the generated privacy label provides more transparency and clarity regarding user data collection, which is important for compliance with CCPA/GDPR.
