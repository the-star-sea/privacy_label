The generated privacy label is better based on the CCPA/GDPR regulations, as it is more specific and detailed in describing the collected and shared data, the purpose of collection, and the types of personal information involved. The original privacy label is somewhat vague in its descriptions, and some of the collected data categories can be considered unnecessary or excessive without a clear purpose. The generated privacy label also explicitly mentions that JioSaavn collects cookies and similar technologies, and explains the user's options to disable them if preferred, which is important for data privacy transparency. Additionally, the generated privacy label provides information about the legal basis for collecting user information under GDPR law, which is helpful for users to understand their rights and give informed consent. Overall, the generated privacy label provides more clarity and transparency for users under CCPA/GDPR regulations.
