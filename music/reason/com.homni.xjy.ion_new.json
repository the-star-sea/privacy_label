The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides specific information about the types of personal information collected, the purpose for which it is collected, and includes the security practices followed by the company. In contrast, the original privacy label is vague and does not provide any valuable information about the collection or sharing of personal data. The generated privacy label also includes an explicit opt-out option for promotional communications, which is in line with GDPR regulations. Overall, the generated privacy label is more comprehensive and transparent than the original one.
