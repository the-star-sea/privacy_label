The generated privacy label is more concise and focused on the essential information that users need to know. It clearly lists the categories of shared and collected data, their purposes, and types, all of which are necessary for users to make informed decisions about sharing their personal data. Furthermore, it includes information about the security practices and users' rights regarding their data, including the ability to request deletion or correction of their data. 

Regarding CCPA/GDPR compliance, both original and generated labels provide users with the necessary information about their data processing activities. However, the generated privacy label avoids duplicating the same sets of data, which often occurs in the original one. Additionally, it specifies users' rights better, which is essential for CCPA compliance. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better suited for CCPA/GDPR compliance.
