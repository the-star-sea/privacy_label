The generated privacy label is better than the original one based on CCPA/GDPR. The generated label provides more comprehensive information about the data collected, the purpose for collection, and the security practices followed by the application. It covers location data, ad interaction data, playlist data, and downloaded music, which will help users make informed decisions about whether to provide their personal data. Additionally, the security practices section of the generated label informs the user about the possibility of their data being shared with third-party ad providers, which is particularly important for GDPR compliance. The original label, on the other hand, provides only limited information about the data collected and security practices, and does not give users the option to delete their data.
