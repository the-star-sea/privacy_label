The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more detailed information about the security practices of the app. The original privacy label does not give any information about how user data is collected, stored, used, or processed, which is necessary for CCPA/GDPR compliance. The generated privacy label provides a clear description of the security practices and also mentions the use of a third-party ad service and its privacy policy. Additionally, the generated privacy label provides information about the permissions requested by the app and how the recorded audio and requested location are used. This information is important for compliance with CCPA/GDPR regulations. Therefore, the generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label in terms of CCPA/GDPR compliance.
