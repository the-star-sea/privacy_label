The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more comprehensive and detailed information about the types of data collected, the purpose for which they are collected, and how they are processed. The generated label also includes information about the rights of the users under the GDPR and CCPA, such as the right to access, delete, and object to the processing of their personal information. The original privacy label is less comprehensive and does not provide enough information about data security and privacy practices. Therefore, the generated privacy label is more compliant with the CCPA/GDPR regulations and provides better transparency to the users.
