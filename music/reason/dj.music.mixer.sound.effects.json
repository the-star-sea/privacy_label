The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more specific information on the types of personal data that are collected and the purpose for which it is collected. It also includes information on users' rights to object, restrict processing, and request access to their personal data, which is required by both the CCPA and GDPR. Additionally, the security practices listed in the generated label are more comprehensive and provide more assurance to users that their data is being protected. However, the original privacy label did provide some information on security practices, which is also important. Overall, the generated privacy label is more comprehensive and meets the requirements of both the CCPA and GDPR.
