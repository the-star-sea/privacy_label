The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more specific information on the type of data that is collected, the purposes for which it is collected, and whether it is optional or not. It also includes information on the security practices of the company. However, it only provides information on one type of data that is collected, while the original privacy label provides a more comprehensive list. The privacy policy includes information on data collection by third-party advertisers and data subject rights. It also includes a statement on not knowingly collecting data from children, and a disclaimer on the inability of security systems to prevent all potential security breaches.
