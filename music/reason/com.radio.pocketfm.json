The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR than the original one. The original privacy label provides a lot of general information on the shared and collected data, and the purposes for which they are used. However, it does not provide sufficient details on the individual rights and provisions available to the users under CCPA/GDPR. 

On the other hand, the generated privacy label provides more detailed information on personal information and usage information collected and used by the company. Additionally, it specifies the individual rights, such as the right to access, correct, delete, and object to the processing of personal information. It also includes the security practices followed by the company and acknowledges receipt of requests made by the customers. 

The privacy policy provided by the company also includes specific sections for CCPA and VCDPA, which outline the rights provided to California and Virginia residents, respectively. Overall, the generated privacy label and privacy policy provide more information and transparency to the customers and align better with CCPA/GDPR requirements.
