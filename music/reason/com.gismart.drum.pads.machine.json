The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it includes more detailed information on the data collected and the purposes for which it is used. The original privacy label seems to lack transparency and clarity in terms of the types of data collected and how it is used. The generated privacy label provides more information on the categories of data collected, including correspondence data, payment data, user content, and tracking ID. Additionally, it outlines the purposes for which the data is collected, such as customer support and feedback, purchases and billing, platform functionality, and analytics and advertising. Furthermore, the security practices outlined in the generated privacy label are more comprehensive and cover data encryption, limited access to personal data and retention, and users' right to access and delete their personal data. Therefore, the generated privacy label appears to be more compliant with the CCPA/GDPR regulations.
