The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance as it provides more specific information on the types of data collected, the purpose of processing, and the legal basis for collection for EU residents. It also includes additional security practices such as contractual obligations for Service Providers and children's data protection. The original privacy label is less specific and does not provide as much information on data collection and processing practices. Additionally, the original privacy label states that data cannot be deleted, which is not compliant with the CCPA's "right to deletion" requirement. The generated privacy label provides more clear and comprehensive information for users to understand how their data is being used and whether they have control over its processing.
