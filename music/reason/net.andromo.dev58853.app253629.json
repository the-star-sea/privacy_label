The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compared to the original privacy label. The original privacy label does not provide detailed information about the data collected and shared by the app, and it also mentions a concerning security practice where data cannot be deleted. On the other hand, the generated privacy label provides more information about the data collected, such as personal information and automatically collected information about hardware and software. It also includes information about third-party partners and their use of personal information, as well as guidance and links for deleting personal data from third-party partners. The privacy policy also states that the app does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. The generated privacy label appears to be more comprehensive and transparent, which is important for meeting the CCPA/GDPR requirements.
