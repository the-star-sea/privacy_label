The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance as it provides more specific information regarding the collected data, third-party data sharing, and the service provider. The original privacy label only provides basic information on security practices and a link to the privacy policy. However, the generated privacy label includes information on log data, cookies, and third-party data sharing with Google Play Services, AdMob, Google Analytics for Firebase, and Facebook. Additionally, it includes a clear statement on the app being a free service provided by the descargar and specific information on the service provided. Providing more specific information in the privacy label is important for transparency and complying with CCPA/GDPR regulations.
