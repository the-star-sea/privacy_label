The generated privacy label is better for CCPA/GDPR compliance as it provides more detailed and specific information about the data collected, shared, and processed by the app. It includes information on personal data, its purpose, and legal basis for processing, which are necessary requirements under these privacy laws. The original privacy label, on the other hand, is quite basic and only covers one type of data collected and its purpose. The privacy policy provided is also very general and does not provide the necessary information about users' rights and how to exercise them. Overall, the generated privacy label provides more transparency and clarity, making it easier for users to understand how their data is being used and protected by the app.
