The generated privacy label is better than the original one based on CCPA/GDPR compliance. The original label lacks clarity and specificity in describing the collected and shared data, which could be problematic when it comes to compliance with these privacy regulations. The generated privacy label has clearly defined data categories, purposes, and types of information collected and shared. It also includes additional security practices and compliance measures like strong password requirements and data breach notifications, which are essential to comply with CCPA/GDPR. However, it is important to note that privacy policy is equally important. The original privacy policy lacks transparency and specific sections on user data collection and sharing. The generated privacy policy, albeit brief, includes relevant clauses on data usage, intellectual property rights, privacy protection, account ownership, and user responsibilities. Overall, both privacy label and policy should aim to provide users with clear and concise information on how their data is being collected, used, stored, and shared.
