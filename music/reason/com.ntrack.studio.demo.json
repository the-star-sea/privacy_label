The generated privacy label seems to provide more detailed information, such as mentioning the legal basis of data processing and including information on cookies. It also includes a category for financial information, which could be relevant for CCPA or GDPR compliance. However, it is unclear if the original privacy label is from the same company or application, so it is difficult to make a direct comparison without that context. Ultimately, whether one label is "better" than the other will depend on the specific requirements of CCPA and GDPR, as well as the individual preferences of users and the company collecting the data.
