Based on CCPA/GDPR, the generated privacy label provides more specific details on the collected and shared data, as well as the purpose for which the data is used. Additionally, it includes information about third-party advertisers and their access to user data, which is crucial for transparency and compliance with regulations. However, it does not include information about the option for users to request the deletion of their data, which is included in the original privacy label. Therefore, a better privacy label would be a combination of both, with specific details on data sharing and collection, purposes, security practices, privacy policy, and user rights, such as the right to delete their data upon request.
