The generated privacy label is not as detailed as the original privacy label, as it only lists one category of collected data: "personal data." The original privacy label provides more specific information about what data is collected and for what purposes, which is important for compliance with CCPA/GDPR. Additionally, the original privacy label includes information about device/other IDs, which may be considered personal data under certain interpretations of the regulations. However, the generated privacy label does include a clear description of the user's rights to access, delete, and manage their personal data, which is an important aspect of CCPA/GDPR compliance. Overall, both privacy labels have strengths and weaknesses, and it would be ideal to have a privacy label that is both comprehensive and easy to understand for users.
