The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR as it provides more specific information about the collected and shared data, stating the type of data and its purpose clearly. The original privacy label is somewhat vague and does not provide a clear picture of how the user's data is used. Additionally, the generated privacy label mentions that users can request account deactivation and that personal data processing can be opted-out, which are both important provisions under CCPA/GDPR. However, it is important to note that the privacy policy provided contains significant information that complements the generated privacy label and explains how the user's data is collected, used, and shared, which is important under CCPA/GDPR.
