The generated privacy label is better based on CCPA/GDPR compliance as it clearly outlines the types of data collected, its purpose, and whether it is optional or mandatory for the user to share. It also specifies the security practices that the company follows to protect the user's data. In contrast, the original privacy label does not give detailed information on the types of data it collects and how it uses the collected data. It only mentions that certain data is collected for App functionality, Analytics, Advertising or marketing, and Personalization. The original privacy label lacks clarity on data sharing practices, and it focuses more on data protection practices. The generated privacy label clearly states the third-party service providers used and their privacy policies. It also includes information on collecting financial transaction data and location-based services, which were absent from the original privacy label. Overall, the generated privacy label is more comprehensive and accurate in terms of CCPA/GDPR compliance.
