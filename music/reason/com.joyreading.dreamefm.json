Based on CCPA/GDPR, the original privacy label seems to be more comprehensive and detailed compared to the generated one. The original label clearly lists the types of data collected and shared, the purposes for which they are collected, and whether they are optional or mandatory. It also specifies the security practices of the company and provides a link to its privacy policy. On the other hand, the generated label lacks essential information such as the optional/mandatory status of shared data, and it also lacks a privacy policy link. Additionally, the original privacy label mentions compliance with CCPA/GDPR regulations, whereas the generated one doesn't. Therefore, the original privacy label is more compliant with CCPA/GDPR regulations and provides better transparency to users.
