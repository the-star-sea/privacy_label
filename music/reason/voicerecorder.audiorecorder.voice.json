The generated privacy label is better than the original privacy label based on CCPA/GDPR compliance because it provides more detailed information about the personal data being collected. The generated privacy label specifies the types of personal information being collected, the purposes for which it will be used, and whether the information will be shared with third-party service providers. Additionally, the generated privacy label includes more robust security practices, including regular data protection impact assessments and PCI-DSS compliance for payment processing. The original privacy label only mentions that data is encrypted in transit and that users can request that data be deleted. The generated privacy label is more transparent and provides users with a better understanding of the data being collected and how it will be used and protected.
