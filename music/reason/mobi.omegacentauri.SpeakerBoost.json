The generated privacy label is better than the original one based on CCPA/GDPR compliance. The original privacy label only mentions device or other IDs as shared data and does not have any information about collected data. Moreover, it does not provide any information regarding the right to opt-out or request data deletion. On the other hand, the generated privacy label provides a detailed list of shared and collected data, including supporting information about the type, purpose, and optionality of the data. It also includes information about the processing location, opt-out availability, and the right to deletion of personal data, which are important under CCPA/GDPR. The privacy policy is also transparent, providing detailed information on personal data processing, opting-out of targeted advertising, and exercising rights. Hence, the generated privacy label is better compliant with CCPA/GDPR than the original privacy label.
