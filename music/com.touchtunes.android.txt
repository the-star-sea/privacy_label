When you access or use our Services or transact business with us, we automatically collect information about you, including:

In accordance with your device permissions, we may also collect information about the precise location of your device. You have the ability to stop the collection of precise location information at any time (see Your Choices below for details), but note that location services must be enabled and you must share your location with us in order to use a jukebox.
Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies:We (and our service providers) use different technologies to collect information, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see Your Choices
In addition, third-party services may be used in connection with the Services. Such services use cookies and similar technologies to analyze how visitors use the Services, to compile statistical reports on activity related to the Services, and to provide other services related to the Services.

We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may collect information about you from third parties, including but not limited to public databases, joint marketing partners, payment processors and facilitators, from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, and from other third parties. Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information, and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site. Similarly, if you link your Spotify account to the Services, we may receive information about music or artists you have played or like, and we may use and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS

TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES

YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
Consumers residing in California are afforded certain additional rights with respect to their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (California Civil Code Section 1798.100 et seq.) (CCPA). If you are a California resident, this section applies to you.
California Consumer Privacy Act
Additional Disclosures Related to the Collection, Use, Disclosure and Sale of Personal Information
Collection and Use of Personal Information: In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers, characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law, commercial information, Internet or other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, audio, electronic, visual or similar information, professional or employment-related information, inferences drawn about you, and other categories of personal information that relate to or are reasonably capable of being associated with you. For examples of the precise data points we collect and the sources of such collection, please see “Collection of Information” above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in “Use of Information” above.
Disclosure of Personal Information: We may share your personal information with third parties as described in the “Sharing of Information” section above. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for business or commercial purposes: identifiers, commercial information, Internet or other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, and inferences.
Sale of Personal Information: California law requires that we provide transparency about, and allow consumers to opt out of, any “sales” of their personal information” which for the purposes of the CCPA broadly means scenarios in which TouchTunes has shared personal information with third parties in exchange for valuable consideration. Although TouchTunes previously “sold” certain personal information, we no longer sell personal information as defined by the CCPA. In the preceding 12 months, we have “sold” the following categories of personal information: identifiers, geolocation data, and inferences. At no point in time have we sold personal information about any consumer whom we knew to be under the age of 16.
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request (1) more information about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected, sold and disclosed for a business purpose in the last 12 months and (2) deletion of your personal information. You may make these requests by emailing us at mobileconsumersupport@touchtunes.com.  Once we receive your request, we will verify it by asking you to provide certain information (e.g., asking for your email address) or as otherwise required by the CCPA. If you would like to use an authorized agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests on your behalf. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
Financial Incentives Program: The CCPA allows us to offer certain financial incentive programs that may result in different prices, rates or quality levels pursuant to your prior opt-in consent and the difference in price, rates or quality levels is directly related to the value that is provided to us by your personal information. We currently provide the following financial incentive program(s): Bar Rewards Loyalty Program and TouchTunes Mobile Rewards Loyalty Program.
The Bar Rewards Loyalty Program allows management and staff at TouchTunes venues to participate in sweepstakes and earn free jukebox credits based on the number of unique check-ins at their TouchTunes venue each week. Jukebox credits may be used to play songs on any mobile-enabled TouchTunes jukebox within the country in which they were earned.  Additional personal information, such as identifiers, including name, phone number, and email address, may be required to participate in such sweepstakes. Management and staff at TouchTunes venues can opt-in to the Bar Rewards Loyalty Program by providing identifiers, including name, phone number, and email address, when they follow the sign-up process at https://www.touchtunes.com/barrewards. Management and staff at TouchTunes venues may opt-out or withdraw from the program at any point by emailing us at mobileconsumersupport@touchtunes.com.
The TouchTunes Mobile Rewards Loyalty Program allows users to earn bonus jukebox credits based on the number of songs users play each month, and to earn special rewards, such as Play Next tokens and the ability to view the next songs in the queue, based on the total number of songs users play over time. Jukebox credits may be used to play songs on any mobile-enabled TouchTunes jukebox within the country in which they were earned.  Play Next tokens allow users to skip the song queue and play their song choice next. Users can opt-in to the TouchTunes Mobile Rewards Loyalty Program by providing identifiers, including name, phone number, and email address, when they sign up for the program. Users may opt-out or withdraw from the program at any point by contacting support through the app or by emailing us at mobileconsumersupport@touchtunes.com.
THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES
The Services may contain links, banners, widgets or advertisements that lead to third-party websites and may use third-party services (see the “Other Information We Collect When You Use Our Services” section in Collection of Information).  Your use of each third-party website is subject to the privacy policy and terms and conditions of such third party, and not this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.  Prior to providing any personal information or otherwise using a third-party website, it is your responsibility to review its privacy policy and terms of service, as we do not have any control or oversight over third-party privacy policies or practices or terms.

You may withdraw your consent at any time to the collection, use, disclosure, or transfer of your personal information by contacting TouchTunes at general@touchtunes.com. If you withdraw your consent (or if you decide not to provide certain personal information), you acknowledge that TouchTunes may not be able to provide you, or continue to provide you, with certain products, services, or information that may be of value to you.
Retention of Personal Information: The personal information that you provide will be retained by TouchTunes in accordance with applicable laws. However, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information we hold if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected.

Upon your written request, and subject to certain exceptions provided by law, TouchTunes will inform you of the existence, use, and disclosure of your personal information and give you access to that information.

Any such information will only be used for the purpose of confirming your identity and will not be retained by TouchTunes.
Interest-Based Advertising: To opt-out of interest-based advertising, and to find information about how to block or limit cookies, visit AdChoices, the Canadian self-regulatory program for online interest-based advertising, administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (“DAAC”).
Canada’s Anti-Spam Law (“CASL”): We will only send you commercial electronic messages (“CEMs”) where we have your express or implied consent to do so. Your consent to receive CEMs is implied where we have an existing business relationship with you, or you have reached out to us and made an inquiry within a certain time frame. You may unsubscribe from receiving CEMs at any time, by clicking the unsubscribe button on an email or following the direction provided in a text message.
