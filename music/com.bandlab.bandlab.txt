2. Information we collect
A. The following is Information which you provide to us directly:
2.1. Registration Information
2.1.1. When you register an account on the Services, we may collect Information such as your name, password, email address, and social network ID (if you have signed up using a social network account (e.g. Facebook or Google)).
2.1.2. Once your account has been registered, your name, username and profile picture (if you have signed up using your Social Network ID) will automatically be displayed on your profile page and will be available to other users through the Services. This allows other users to identify you, find you, and refer to you properly.
2.2. Profile Information
2.2.1. In addition to your name and username, which are automatically displayed on your profile page, you may provide additional Information on your profile page such as your profile picture (if not already available via your sign up using your Social Network ID), date of birth, gender, location and other information about yourself and your interests.
2.2.2. Any such Information which you add to your profile page (except for date of birth and gender) on the Services becomes publicly available. Please exercise personal discretion in how much Information you choose to share.
2.3. Content which you upload to the Services, which allows others to identify you (e.g. photos of you, audio recordings or text containing your name, voice, status updates, comments on content which refer to you).
2.4. Communications between you and us (e.g. your reply to our service updates, emails to you, and support tickets).
B. The following is Information which other users provide about you:

Content which others upload to the Services which allows you to be identified (e.g. photos of you, audio recordings or text containing your name, status updates, comments on content which refer to you).
C. Other Information which we receive when running the Services:
2.6. Information
2.6.1. We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services. These tools collect information sent by your device including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Services. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user.
2.7. Cookies and similar technologies
2.7.1. The Services may contain “cookies”, clear gifs (also known as “web beacons” or “web bugs”), or similar technology. A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser, which will store the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies, or where you are a resident of the European Economic Area, if you have provided your consent to the use of cookies.
2.7.2. The Services use cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technologies as they are developed to customise your experience with our website and Services. Most Internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions or “Help” screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some services and portions of this website may not function properly.
2.8. Log file information
2.8.1. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of a web page or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
2.8.2. When you use the Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Services, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our users which then helps us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Services.
2.9. Device identifiers
2.9.1. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access the Services, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, that uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us.
2.9.2. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Services and may help us or others provide reports or personalised content and ads. Some features of the Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
3. How we use your Information
3.1. How we use (or ‘process’) your Information will depend on the nature of your interaction with the Services and with us. Under data protection law we must have a specific lawful basis for the processing of your Information. We rely on several lawful bases for different activities as follows:
3.1.1 Some processing is necessary for the performance of the contract (i.e. our Terms of Use) between you and us and / or taking steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract. For example, when you register with us and set up an account, this allows us to provide you with the Services.
3.1.2 Some processing is necessary for our legitimate interests.

l) To make music programming decisions and to comply with copyright reporting obligations;
m) To process payments made by or to you;

5. How we store your Information
5.1. We (or others on our behalf) may transfer your Information to other countries in which our facilities or businesses are located, to be stored or processed. We will ensure that where we transfer your personal data outside of Singapore, the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area, we will put in place all necessary safeguards to protect that personal data, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
